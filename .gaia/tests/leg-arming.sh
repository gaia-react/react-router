# leg-arming.sh: whether one leg of .github/workflows/audit-ci-tests.yml's
# `shards` matrix should run its `code:`-gated steps for this pull request's
# changed files. Prints exactly `true` or `false`.
#
# That job's arming step calls this once per leg and copies the literal into
# $GITHUB_OUTPUT; each per-leg `code:`-gated step then carries the answer as an
# ADDITIONAL conjunct beside its paths-filter conjunct, never instead of it. The
# workflow's guard suite (.gaia/tests/lib/audit-ci-shards.bats) drives this file
# offline, per leg and per narrowable page, and compares the answers against a
# recomputation of its own, so this file is the declared side of that
# comparison.
#
# Maintainer-only. `.gaia/tests` is wholesale release-excluded via
# `.gaia/release-exclude`, so this never reaches an adopter.
#
# Usage:
#   bash .gaia/tests/leg-arming.sh            # the arming answer, `true` or `false`
#   bash .gaia/tests/leg-arming.sh class      # the narrowable class, one path per line
#   bash .gaia/tests/leg-arming.sh -h | --help
#
# Inputs, all through the environment; no argument carries data:
#   GITHUB_EVENT_NAME   `workflow_dispatch` arms unconditionally.
#   CHANGED_FILES_JSON  the JSON array the paths-filter step exposes as
#                       `code_files` under `list-files: json`. A contributor
#                       picks those names, so the list is hostile input. The
#                       workflow withholds an oversized list, so it arrives
#                       here as the empty string and arms through the
#                       empty-list rule below.
#   LEG_ID              the matrix leg being decided.
#   PR_CHANGED_FILES    github.event.pull_request.changed_files, a decimal.
#
# Seams, each independently overridable. A value beginning with `/` is used
# as-is; anything else resolves against the root, never against $PWD:
#   LEG_ARMING_ROOT             default: the checkout holding this file
#   LEG_ARMING_SHARDER          default: .gaia/tests/bats-shards.sh
#   LEG_ARMING_WORKFLOW         default: .github/workflows/audit-ci-tests.yml
#   LEG_ARMING_CONCURRENCY_DIR  default: .gaia/tests/concurrency
#   LEG_ARMING_CONCURRENCY_LEG  default: see its declaration below
# The sharder's own directory seams pass straight through the environment to
# it. A path it prints repo-relative is resolved against LEG_ARMING_ROOT, so a
# test tree either keeps the two roots equal or points every sharder seam at an
# absolute path. That tree also needs a stand-in at
# <root>/.gaia/tests/lib/audit-ci-shards.bats, listed through the sharder's lib
# seam, and a concurrency seam holding at least one suite: without either, the
# script cannot place a leg and every leg arms, so no answer in that tree could
# ever be `false`.
#
# Exit status: 0 on every path of the arming answer, degraded ones included.
# `class` exits 2, with nothing on stdout, when it cannot derive a non-empty
# class. Diagnostics go to stderr, and none carries a changed filename: they
# name a reason and a count.
#
# THE DIRECTION OF FAILURE IS THE DESIGN. Every `code:` entry exists because a
# suite's source was edited, the filter said false, and the job greened having
# run that suite zero times; a narrowing manufactures exactly that hazard. So
# anything this script cannot resolve arms the leg, and the answer is decided
# OUTSIDE the derivation: `decide` carries every rule and prints its answer, and
# the code at the bottom of this file replaces anything but the two literals
# with `true` before printing. No failure inside `decide` reaches the exit
# without passing that check.
#
# errexit is deliberately not relied on inside `decide`. Under
# `out="$(decide)" || ...` bash 3.2 honors a `set -e` the function sets and
# bash 5 ignores it, so the same failure would abort on one runner and run on
# into a wrong answer on the other. Every failure is an explicit status check.
#
# The rules run cheapest first, and classification runs before any sharder call
# or scan. The common case, a pull request touching code, therefore costs one
# pass over the list, and no changed filename ever reaches grep: every scan is
# keyed on the class member a changed path equals, and that string came from
# this repository's own workflow.
#
# The class is DERIVED, never checked in: the `wiki/` paths the `code:` filter
# names, read from the workflow text at run time with awk. Not with a YAML
# parser, because this runs before the step that installs PyYAML. The reader
# takes the paths-filter step in the order the workflow writes it, `uses:`
# before `with:`, and any shape it does not recognize is a derivation failure,
# which arms. The guard suite compares its answer against a real YAML parser's.
#
# The scan is a superset of the files that name a page literally: every suite
# the sharder discovers, the `helpers/`, `lib/` and `fixtures/` subtrees beside
# them, and the concurrency seam, matched by full path or bare basename, with no
# filter on the matched line. A `case` arm or a docblock line naming a page arms
# like a real read, because no rule telling them apart fails in a safe
# direction.
#
# One exception narrows it: A NAMER OF ALL IS A NAMER OF NONE. A file naming
# every member of the class tells no page from another, so it is excluded from
# every page's namer set. The exclusion is derived from the class at run time,
# with no threshold and no file named. With a single-member class every namer
# would be a namer of all, so the rule is inert there. THE ACCEPTED RISK: a
# suite that genuinely reads the content of every class member is excluded and
# does not arm. That is real under-arming. It is accepted because no such suite
# exists today, because the leg holding the derived check arms unconditionally
# regardless, and because every other rule here fails open. A related, smaller
# gap: a suite that drives a page-reading script without naming the page
# itself, in its own source, sits on a leg the gate may decline to arm.
#
# It writes nothing to $GITHUB_OUTPUT, $GITHUB_ENV or $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY.
# Those files are line-oriented, a filename may carry a newline, and one echoed
# diagnostic would let a crafted name append its own record and disarm every
# leg on a green required check. The workflow step writes the literal this
# prints and nothing else.
#
# Portability: bash 3.2 safe, the contract bats-shards.sh states. No mapfile, no
# declare -A, no ${var^^}, no wait -n, no eval. Every array expansion is written
# ${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}, because on bash 3.2 an empty array expanded bare under
# `set -u` aborts, and here that would abort the derivation on exactly the
# input the fallback exists for. Every sort and grep runs under LC_ALL=C.

# The derived both-ways check lives in this suite, so the leg holding it always
# arms: a rename or deletion of a narrowable page whose namers sit elsewhere
# must not skip the check that pins the map the edit invalidates. The shard
# holding it is asked of the sharder, never named here.

  # inert with every check still green. An absent or non-decimal value does not
