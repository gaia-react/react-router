# Tests for .gaia/statusline/gaia-statusline.sh state anchoring and the
# worktree gate across trees.
#
# Every right-side segment reads SHARED state: the update-check cache, the debt
# count, and the setup marker are all scope "shared" in
# .gaia/state-registry.json, which means one physical copy under the MAIN
# checkout's .gaia/local. The setup nudge renders from every tree: it is the
# one blocking, per-clone precondition, and a worktree session has no other way
# to learn it is owed. Every other segment, and the two background refreshers
# that keep the cache warm, are a task queue for the main checkout, so a linked
# worktree is gated out of all of it. Failure direction on the gate itself is
# render: an unresolvable or indeterminate worktree answer degrades to "not a
# worktree". A flow that must run on the main checkout refuses out loud when it
# is invoked, which is where the harder guarantee belongs.
#
# What each test varies is the SESSION's directory (the status payload's
# .workspace.current_dir), never the script's install path. Every test runs
# MAIN's copy of the script, mirroring the maintainer-wrapper case: the wrapper
# execs the shipped script from the main checkout even while the session runs in
# a worktree, so an install-path signal answers for the wrong checkout.
#
# HOME points at an empty dir so the left-side delegation is inert and the
# assertions see only the right side.

# it verbatim. Sibling suites carry the same block, so a change here belongs in

#
# The `sed` range this replaces was not that text. A range checks its end
# address only from the line AFTER the start matches, so a line carrying both
# markers opened a range and swallowed to the next end or to EOF, where the
# shipped parser drops that one line alone. `gaia-statusline.sh` carries only a
# plain pair today, so the two agreed; nothing went red if a one-line marker
