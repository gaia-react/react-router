# shell-lint.sh: run shellcheck over every tracked shell script, bats suite, and

# oracle-blind invocation guard
# (.gaia/scripts/lint-oracle-blind-invocations.sh), the stale-cardinal guard
# (.gaia/scripts/lint-stale-cardinals.sh), the guard-rule shell-coverage

# Exit 0 when clean, 1 on any finding at or above the severity floor, and 1 on
# a pass that cannot run at all (no shellcheck binary, an empty *.sh discovery
# set, an unusable bash-3.2 interpreter). A red gate is therefore not always a
# findings list; the ERROR line says which case it is. Exit 2 is neither: it is
# a usage error, a bad argument, and no pass ran at all.
# Run it directly from anywhere: `bash .gaia/tests/shell-lint.sh`.
#
# Usage: shell-lint.sh [--only bash32-parse]
#
# `--only bash32-parse` runs the bash-3.2 parse pass and nothing else. That is
# how .github/workflows/shell-lint.yml arms that pass on a macOS runner, which
# is the only host in this repo's CI carrying a real bash 3.2, without paying
# for the shellcheck harness there: macOS runner minutes bill at 10x, and every
# other pass either needs shellcheck or reads a surface the ubuntu leg already
# covers. The parse pass is the one whose verdict depends on the host's
# /bin/bash, so it is the one worth a second runner.
#
# Maintainer-only. Adopters run GAIA's bash but never author it, so the linter
# guarding the framework's own shell has no adopter surface. Excluded from the
# release tarball by the `.gaia/tests` entry in `.gaia/release-exclude`.
#
# Why a gate and not just the audit agent: the code-audit-maintainer-shell agent
# already treats shellcheck as an authoritative oracle, but it is dispatched by a
# model and is advisory-only, so nothing *enforces* a clean tree. Hand-applied
# linting regresses silently. This is the deterministic backstop; the agent keeps
# the lenses shellcheck cannot model (hook fail-open, stdin-JSON shape,
# `jq -n` injection safety).
#
# Two severity floors over three discovery passes, because the file types carry
# different noise profiles:
#
#   *.sh   -> `style`, the strictest floor. The genuine style/info-tier codes are
#            curated: SC1091/SC1090 (shellcheck cannot follow a dynamically
#            sourced path) are excluded below as pure tooling artifacts, and the
#            intentional single-quoted jq/awk programs (SC2016) carry file-level
#            `# shellcheck disable=SC2016` directives, so the gate stays live to a
#            genuine SC2016 bug in any file that does not opt out.
#
#   .husky/* -> `style` as well, but linted as POSIX `sh` in a pass of its own.
#            The hooks are extensionless, so no glob above reaches them, and
#            husky runs each one as `sh -e`, so bash-only constructs must fail
#            here even though they pass in the *.sh pass.
#
#   *.bats -> `warning`. Errors and warnings are the tiers with live failure
#            modes (a masked `!` assertion that never fails a test [SC2314], a
#            `local x=$(...)` that swallows the command's exit [SC2155], a `cd`
#            with no `|| exit` guard [SC2164]). The `info`/`style` tiers on bats
#            are dominated by structural false positives from the bats execution
#            model (SC2317 unreachable `@test`/`setup`/`teardown` bodies,
#            SC2030/SC2031 subshell state from `run`, SC2016 assertion strings);
#            those sit below the `warning` floor and never fire, so bats needs no
#            blunt per-code exclude list. Run `shellcheck -S style <file>` by hand
#            to see the sub-floor tiers.
#
# Never begin a comment line with the bare word `shellcheck`: a comment of that
# shape is parsed as a directive, and a malformed one (SC1072/SC1073) aborts the
# parse of the whole file, silently leaving it unlinted. Write "Run shellcheck
# ..." or "The shellcheck binary ..." instead. Two lines in this very file tripped
# that trap on the gate's first CI run.

# Fold in the errexit status-read guard, for the same reason as the four above:

# substitution's exit status, so under `set -e` a failing command exits ON the
# assignment line and the `rc=$?` after it never runs -- every branch written to
# handle that failure is dead. SC2181 reaches the `if [ $? ]` spelling after a
# plain command and draws nothing on a capture, and shellcheck does not model
# `set -e` assignment status at all. It reaches further than the *.sh passes
# above for the same reason the path-quoting guard does: `run:` bodies are shell
# no *.sh glob sees, and that is exactly where both shipped instances of the
# class lived. Run from the repo root so its `git ls-files` discovery resolves
# and the file:line it prints is repo-relative.

# Fold in the stale-cardinal guard, for a reason none of the guards above share:
# what it reads is not shell at all, it is the PROSE the shell carries. A
# comment or a bats test name asserting how many of something the tree holds is
# a claim nothing recounts, so it stays green while the set it names moves
# underneath it, and every tool above is blind to it by construction: shellcheck
# models the language, and the class lives in the text the language ignores.
# This gate is where it lands rather than in a suite of its own because the
# shell and bats half of its scan surface is already this gate's surface, and
# this is the pass every pull request runs. Its other half, the C-family globs
# `.claude/rules/code-comments.md` binds, reaches past this gate's own surface,
# so the paths filter in .github/workflows/shell-lint.yml carries those globs
# too: a filter narrower than the surface it arms greens a check that scanned
# nothing. Run from the repo root so its `git ls-files` discovery resolves and
# the file:line it prints is repo-relative.

# Fold in the guard-rule shell-coverage guard. Like the stale-cardinal guard

# tracked shell file neither list names is one whose author is shown neither rule,
# and nothing else in this repository notices, because a rule that loads nowhere
# and a rule with nothing to say are the same silence. It lands in this gate
# because its scan surface IS this gate's surface -- the tracked shell set -- and
# this is the pass every pull request runs. It is advisory here; the blocking
# runner is its sibling suite .gaia/scripts/tests/lint-guard-rule-shell-coverage.bats
# in the `Audit CI Tests` scripts shard, armed by that job's `**/*.sh` code
# filter AND by its `.husky/**` entry: `**/*.sh` matches no extensionless
# hook, so a pull request touching only .husky/pre-commit arms this check
# through the husky glob alone. Both are named because that entry's own
# stated reason is a different suite, and trimming it on that reason would
# silently unarm this check for husky-only diffs.

# Fold in the collapsed signal-trap guard, for the same reason as the guards

# INT or TERM silently deletes the terminating disposition it replaced and the
# script becomes uninterruptible. The class was repaired by hand twice and
# pinned each time by a per-file assertion in that script's own suite, which is
# the hand-kept list .claude/rules/guards-must-fail.md names as an arming-stage
# failure: the third instance sat unreached by any of it. This gate is what

# that shellcheck cannot model, and the arming line for settings.json lives in
# .github/workflows/shell-lint.yml's paths filter alongside the others. It takes
# the root explicitly rather than resolving one ambiently: it reads two fixed
# paths and needs neither a working checkout nor git on PATH to compare them,
# and this harness already holds the value its argument-free arm would re-derive.
