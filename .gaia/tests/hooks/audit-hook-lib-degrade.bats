# The degrade branch under a hook's library resolution has to be reachable.
#
# A hook that arms errexit and resolves its library directory with a command
# substitution takes that substitution's exit status on the assignment. With
# `.claude/hooks/lib/` absent -- a partial /update-gaia, an interrupted
# checkout, a hand-deleted directory -- the inner `cd` fails and errexit ends
# the hook ON the assignment, so the `[ -n "$_lib_dir" ]` branch written
# directly below it never runs, in exactly the case it was written for
# (gaia-react/gaia#1590).
#
# The member set is DERIVED from the hooks rather than restated here, so a hook
# that later grows the same resolution is covered without editing this file.
# A member arms errexit, installs no ERR trap, and resolves a `lib`
# subdirectory of its own on-disk location.
#
# A derivation that comes back SHORT is worse than one that comes back empty:
# the empty read trips a non-empty guard, while a short read leaves every
# assertion satisfied over a shrunken set whose name still says "every". The
# member predicate above matches one spelling, and the same defect can be
# written others (`${BASH_SOURCE[0]%/*}`, or a two-step resolve into a `lib`
# child on the following line). So a second, deliberately loose candidate
# predicate runs beside it, and every candidate it names has to be either a
# member or a NAMED exclusion. A hook that is neither fails this suite instead
# of quietly leaving the driven set.
#
# The loose predicate takes a hook that arms errexit, installs no ERR trap, and
# opens a command substitution with a `cd` anywhere in its text. It reads the
# file rather than a line, so a resolve split across two lines escapes neither
# half, and it says nothing about WHAT the hook cds to: the location can be
# spelled `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}`, `$0`, or a variable set forty lines earlier, and
# the hook is a candidate either way.
#
# Neither of those two terms is a claim about every way a shell can reach the
# state it names. "Arms errexit" means what `lib_degrade_errexit_armed` below
# reads, and that reader's own header states which spellings it takes. "Opens a
# command substitution with a `cd`" means literally `$(cd`, optional space
# allowed, which is where this defect has to live: the branch goes unreachable
# only when the assignment can take a FAILING status, and a plain parameter
# expansion (`${BASH_SOURCE[0]%/*}/lib`) cannot fail that way, so it is out of
# scope rather than missed. Two shapes ARE outside the reach rather than out of
# scope: a substitution whose `cd` is not its first word, and a resolve
# outsourced to a helper the hook sources.
#
# It filters the ERR-trap family mechanically, for a checked reason: that trap
# sends the failing assignment to the same silent exit 0 the degrade branch
# would have reached (each such branch ends `|| true` and is followed by a
# `type ... || exit 0`), so the branch is unreachable with no change in
# outcome. That is a shape difference, not a defect, and driving it here would
# assert an obligation those hooks do not carry.
#
# What is left is not machine-derivable and is enumerated by hand below, with a
# warrant per entry, in NOT_MEMBERS.
#
# Each member is driven from a copy in a directory holding no `lib` sibling,
# which is what BASH_SOURCE-based resolution reads, against a control copy
# beside a real `lib`. Same argv, same stdin: an absent library must not change
# the hook's verdict at this point, because both paths reach the same
# downstream precondition. The one library that does change it is the
# jq-availability arm, which a blocking hook may not run without; that refusal
# is asserted as its own outcome rather than exempted, in the test below.

# Armed-and-untrapped, the half both derivations below share. It is ONE reader

# widening of the arming spelling could land in one and leave nothing red: that
# is the short-read hazard this file's own header warns about, one level up in
# the predicate feeding it.
#
# Armed reads the two spellings this repo's own errexit lints accept
# (`.gaia/scripts/lint-errexit-source-guard.sh`, `lint-errexit-status-read.sh`):
# an `e` inside a short option bundle (`set -e`, `set -euo pipefail`), or an
# explicit `set -o errexit`. Either may sit at any position on the line, ahead
# of any `#`, so a trailing comment naming `-e` does not arm. `set +e` suspends
# rather than arms and is not read as arming.
#
# What it reads is literally a `-<letters>` token containing an `e`, so it does
# not model `--` ending option parsing: `set -- "$@" -meta` reads as armed. No
# hook spells that, and the direction is fail-closed if one ever does. An
# over-armed hook joins the candidate set and then owes a member match or a
# NOT_MEMBERS warrant, so the cost of the over-read is a red, never a miss.

# Hooks the loose predicate below names that are deliberately not members. One
# entry per line, `<basename> <reason>`; the reason is the warrant, and a hook
# arriving here without one is what the reconciliation test refuses.
# Every entry shares one warrant, stated per line so a reader sees which
# directory each one resolves: none of them resolves a `lib` CHILD, which is the
# subdirectory that can genuinely be absent. A hook's own directory was read to
# run it, and an ancestor of that directory contains it, so both exist by
# construction and neither substitution has a reachable failure to degrade from.
#
# That warrant is RE-CHECKED rather than trusted. An exclusion matched on its
# basename alone would be permanent: a listed hook that later grows a lib-child
# resolution would keep its entry, stay out of the driven set, and carry a
# warrant beside its name that has quietly become false. So the reconciliation
# below also re-reads each excluded hook, and an entry whose warrant stops
# holding fails the suite instead of shielding it.
#
# What that re-check reads, exactly: a `$(cd` substitution naming a `lib` child
# ON ONE LINE. It spans the whole substitution rather than stopping at the
# first `)`, because this repo's house spelling nests a substitution inside it
# (`$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/lib" && pwd)`) and puts the `/lib`
# after that inner close paren, where a non-crossing match cannot reach it.
#
# It is line-level while the candidate term below is file-level, so one shape
# escapes it: a resolve that reaches its lib child through an intermediate
# variable (`_libpath="$_self/lib"` on one line, `$(cd "$_libpath" ...)` on the
# next) satisfies neither this re-check nor the member literal, and would keep
# its exclusion. No hook here spells that, and closing it means a second
# hand-rolled pattern guessing at how far the indirection runs, which is the
# cost this file has already paid twice. It is named rather than closed, and an
# author adding an indirected resolve to a listed hook owes this list an edit.

# The loose candidate set: a hook that `lib_degrade_errexit_armed` reads as
# armed and untrapped, and whose text opens a command substitution with a `cd`
# anywhere. That is ONE text term, not two. It used to also require a literal
# `BASH_SOURCE`, and that conjunct was a short read: a hook resolving its own
# location as `$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/lib" && pwd)` carries the #1590 defect
# exactly, matched neither this predicate nor the member literal, and so left
# the driven set with nothing red. Dropping the conjunct named the identical
# hooks on the clean tree, so it was buying no precision to trade away.
#
# The term is FILE-level rather than line-level on purpose, which is what lets
