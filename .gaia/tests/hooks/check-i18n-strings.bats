# Tests for .claude/hooks/check-i18n-strings.sh.
#
# Advisory PreToolUse nudge: when a page or component .tsx is written, remind
# once per session that user-facing strings belong behind t(). It blocks
# nothing -- it always exits 0 and carries its whole payload on stderr -- so
# there is no deny to assert. What CAN break is the reminder firing on the
# wrong files, firing on every edit instead of once, or going silent entirely,
# and each of those is invisible in normal use. The tests below pin all three.
#
# The once-per-session marker (.claude/i18n-strings-checked) is written
# relative to the working directory, so every scenario runs in a throwaway
# directory via `invoke_hook_in` rather than in the repo.
