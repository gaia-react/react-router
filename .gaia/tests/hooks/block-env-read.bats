# Tests for .claude/hooks/block-env-read.sh.
#
# This hook is the WHOLE read-side guard for dotenv paths: settings.json carries
# no Read() deny rule behind it. It covers the Read tool and the Bash readers
# (including the grep family) against .env and every variant (.env.local,
# .env.*, not .env.example); sourcing; redirection; `env FOO=1 <reader>`; and
# bare environment dumps (env/printenv/...) that read the shell environment
# rather than a file. The guard is heuristic defense-in-depth, not a sandbox: it
# always exits 0, carrying the allow/deny decision in stdout JSON.
#
# The settings.json assertions at the bottom pin the absence of every Read()
# deny rule. That absence is load-bearing rather than incidental: a single
# Read() rule re-arms Claude Code's bypass-immune deniedPathInsideDirectory
# circuit breaker, which forces a manual approval prompt on every recursive
# search or copy in the tree.

# Run the hook with lib/reader-operands.sh absent, to exercise the grammar-load
# failure arm.
#
# The hook is COPIED into this test's own temporary directory and driven from
# there, with no library beside it. It must never be exercised by hiding the
# real one: both read-guard suites would target the identical absolute path,
# .gaia/tests/bats-shards.sh weighs by file size and may put them in one shard
# or in two, and .gaia/tests/run-bats-parallel.sh forks every shard into ONE
# shared workspace. One shard is if anything the stronger reason rather than a
# reprieve: the pair then runs sequentially inside a single bats invocation over
# that same one workspace.
# While one suite held the library hidden, every allow-assertion in its sibling
# would see the fail-closed deny, so the pair would flake against each other and
# the concurrency-safety claim that runner makes would be false. The live
# session's own Read, Grep and Bash calls run through these same hooks and would
# be denied for the width of that window too.
#
# The hook resolves its library as `dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"/lib`, so a copy
# in a directory with an empty lib/ beside it reaches for a file that is not
# there, which is the missing-library arm exactly. The directory is created and
# left empty rather than omitted so the arm under test is the absent FILE rather
# than an unresolvable lib dir; both deny, and pinning the narrower one is what
# makes this a test of the probe instead of a test of `cd`.
