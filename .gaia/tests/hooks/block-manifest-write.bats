#
# `.gaia/manifest.json` is release-generated; adopter feature work never adds
# to it. This guard denies writes to it through the edit tools (Edit / Write /
# MultiEdit, no exemption) and through common Bash write vectors (output
# redirects, tee, sed -i, sponge, cp/mv as destination), while allowing reads
# and the two legitimate Bash writers that prepend the GAIA_MANIFEST_WRITE=
# exemption marker. The guard is best-effort, not airtight: it always exits 0,
# carrying the allow/deny decision in stdout JSON.
