# Every test exports its own FAKE_GH_PR_BODY into the subshell bats creates

# Tests for `.claude/hooks/issue-claim-release.sh`, the PostToolUse Bash hook
# that strips the `in-progress` claim label from every issue a merged pull
# request closes.
#
# Each test runs the hook against a throwaway git repo, with a fake `gh` on
# PATH that answers `pr view` from FAKE_GH_PR_STATE / FAKE_GH_PR_BODY and
# records every `pr view` ref and `issue edit` call under $FAKE_GH_STATE for
# assertions. Nothing is staged for `repo-scope.sh`: the hook resolves that
# lib from its OWN location rather than from cwd, so it reaches the real one
# beside it and a sandbox copy would never be read.
#
# The sandbox repo's toplevel directory is named exactly `gaia`, matching the
# repo-NAME half of the home slug the fake gh reports (`gaia-react/gaia`). The
# hook compares the whole [HOST/]OWNER/REPO against that slug rather than the
# directory basename, so the name decides nothing on its own. It is kept
# because it is what makes the same-named-sibling fixtures adversarial:
# `--repo other-org/gaia` is precisely the value a repo-NAME comparison calls
# home, so those cases red the moment the boundary regresses to one.
