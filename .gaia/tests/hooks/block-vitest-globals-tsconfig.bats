# Tests for .claude/hooks/block-vitest-globals-tsconfig.sh.
#
# `vitest/globals` in tsconfig.json makes describe/expect/test ambient, which
# hides missing imports from the type checker and lets a test file that would
# not compile on its own pass. The guard blocks a write that puts that string
# into a tsconfig.json.
#
# MECHANISM: exit code, not JSON. This hook blocks by exiting 2 with a BLOCKED
# message on stderr and allows by exiting 0 silently, so the assertions here are
# `assert_blocked_by_exit` / `assert_allowed_by_exit`, not the `_by_json` pair
# its Edit|Write|MultiEdit siblings use. Under this contract the allow case is
# an assertion of silence, which is what makes the abstain tests below worth
# writing: a guard that had started blocking everything would still exit 0 on
# nothing at all.
