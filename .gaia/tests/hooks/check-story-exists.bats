# Tests for .claude/hooks/check-story-exists.sh.
#
# Advisory PreToolUse nudge: when a component's index.tsx is written and no
# sibling tests/index.stories.tsx exists, remind that the story is missing. It
# blocks nothing and always exits 0, so its only observable behavior is the
# stderr line -- which means a break is silent, and the reminder simply stops
# arriving for every component written from then on.
#
# Unlike its i18n sibling this hook has no session marker: it fires on every
# qualifying write and goes quiet the moment the story exists. The existence
# check resolves relative to the working directory, so every scenario runs in a
# throwaway directory via `invoke_hook_in`.
