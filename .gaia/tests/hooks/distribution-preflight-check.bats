# Tests for the distribution pre-flight gate
# (.claude/hooks/distribution-preflight-check.sh), the PreToolUse hook that
# denies `gh pr create` when a file this branch newly ships has no answer in
# the committed .gaia/manifest.json.
#
# The tests drive the REAL hook by absolute path ($HOOK_ABS) with cwd set to a
# fixture git repo, exactly as the harness runs it: a PreToolUse JSON payload
# on stdin, allow vs deny carried in stdout (the hook always exits 0; a deny
# emits `"permissionDecision": "deny"`).
#
# The maintainer binary is mocked as a fixture script that prints a
# `release manifest --check --json` report. The hook resolves it as the
# repo-relative path .gaia/cli/gaia-maintainer, so the mock lands inside the
# fixture repo and the real binary is never invoked.
#
# Fixture shape, three branches in a chain so the resolved base actually
# changes the answer:
#
#   main     base.txt
#   develop  + shipped.txt   (branched from main)
#   feature  + feature.txt   (branched from develop)
#
# The mock reports shipped.txt as `missing`. Against the default base (main)
# the three-dot changed set is {shipped.txt, feature.txt}, which intersects and
# DENIES. Against an explicit `--base develop` it is {feature.txt}, which does
# not intersect and ALLOWS.
#
# That asymmetry is deliberate and load-bearing: it is what gives the base-ref
# tests teeth. If develop and main pointed at the same commit, a hook that
# parsed `--base=develop` correctly and one that ignored the flag entirely
# would produce identical output, and the tests would pass against the bug
# they exist to catch.
#
# Assertion style (.claude/rules/bats-assertions.md): `grep -q` / `[ ]` /
# explicit `return 1`; absence assertions written as
# `<positive-bad-case> && return 1`, never `! grep -q`.

# carrying non-ASCII or control bytes: it wraps the path in double quotes and
# backslash-escapes the offending bytes, emitting the quotes as literal
# characters. `missing` reaches the intersection through `jq -r`, which emits raw
# bytes, so the two sides speak different encodings for exactly the paths at
# issue. `comm -12` then matches nothing, `offenders` comes back empty, and the
# hook ALLOWS `gh pr create` for a newly-shipping file with no ship-or-withhold
# answer. An empty `offenders` set is also what a correctly-answered branch
# produces, so by then the failure is indistinguishable from an ordinary pass.
