# Tests for .claude/hooks/block-invalid-yaml-write.sh.
#
# Regression coverage for tech-debt #867: Claude repeatedly authors invalid
# YAML plain scalars (a mid-sentence ": " read as a mapping-key separator, or
# a stray " #" read as a comment that silently truncates the value) and only
# discovers it when a downstream parser or lint fails, sometimes on an
# already-saved artifact. This guard reconstructs the resulting content for
# an Edit/Write/MultiEdit call, extracts the YAML region (the whole file for
# .yml/.yaml, or the --- frontmatter block for .md), and denies the call on
# a real parse failure. It fails open on anything it cannot resolve: no
# python3+pyyaml, a target that doesn't exist yet, or an old_string it can't
# locate in the current file.
#
# Assertion style note: per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md, non-final
# absence checks use a positive match for the bad case plus an explicit
# `return 1`, never `!`-negation.

# The hook parses YAML with python3 + PyYAML and fails open without it, so every
# assertion in this file depends on the parser being present. On CI that parser is
# a precondition rather than a maybe: audit-ci-tests.yml installs python3-yaml in
# the same job that runs this suite. So the CI branch FAILS instead of skipping. A
# skip reports `ok ... # skip` and greens the job, so a runner that lost that
# install would retire every test in this file in silence, the hollow guard this
# suite exists to prevent on the hook, turned on the suite itself. The gate test in
# the first section below proves this branch fires. Matches the same-shaped gates in
# .gaia/scripts/tests/retrigger-reachability.bats and .gaia/tests/lib/lint-yaml.bats.

# --- the parser gate itself ---
#
# setup() routes every test in this file through `require_yaml_parser`, which makes
# that one function the single point where all of them can be turned off at once. On
# a CI runner it has to FAIL rather than skip, and nothing else here would notice if
# it stopped: weakening it back to a bare `skip` would red nothing, and a runner that
# lost its python3-yaml install would report `ok ... # skip` for every test and green
# the job. This test is what makes that weakening red. It runs through setup() like
# every other test here, so it cannot escape the gate it covers: what it catches is
# the weakening, not the condition.
