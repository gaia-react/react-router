# Sweep #9 of local-janitor.sh: the registry-driven outlier sweep.
#
# Sweep 9 walks exactly three scope roots (top level of .gaia/local, its
# audit/, its cache/) at maxdepth-1/mindepth-1. For every child it asks the
# state registry (.gaia/state-registry.json, through gaia_registry_recognizes
# in .gaia/scripts/state-registry-lib.sh) whether the child is recognized -- a
# live entry or a named residue path. A recognized child is kept, silently.
# An unrecognized child is reported on stderr and left in place: report,
# never reap. OS junk is the one exception, reaped at any age regardless of
# the registry. The registry is the single answer to "may I reap this?",
# replacing the three hardcoded JANITOR_OUTLIER_ALLOW_* allowlists this sweep
# used to consult (now deleted from the source).
#
# GAIA_JANITOR_SWEEP_ONLY=outliers runs sweep 9 alone (skipping sweeps 2-8 and
# the one-time migration blocks), so every assertion below is attributable to
# sweep 9 itself, not a sibling sweep.
#
# Retired from the pre-registry suite, and why: UAT-001/002 (aged-vs-fresh
# off-allowlist reap) asserted the destructive default this conversion
# removes -- an unrecognized child is never reaped now, at any age, so there
# is no "aged" case left to distinguish. UAT-003/004/005/007 built elaborate
# per-zone allowlist enumerations whose only remaining true assertion
# (survival) no longer distinguishes "correctly recognized by the registry"
# from "nothing but OS junk is ever reaped any more" -- surviving is not
# proof of recognition once reaping unrecognized children is gone, so the
# distinguishing signal has to be the stderr report, which those tests never
# checked. UAT-010/010b exercised GAIA_OUTLIER_RETENTION_DAYS floor-clamping,
# a knob this sweep no longer reads (age never gates anything but OS junk).
# UAT-011/011b/011c were the disjoint-owner guard: they grepped sweep-9's own
# allowlist arrays to keep them in sync with sweep 2/5's age-managed globs --
# exactly the "test whose only job is keeping duplicates in sync" class this
# registry conversion exists to dissolve, since sweep 9 has no arrays left to
# drift. Replaced below by REG-001..007, which assert the new report-vs-keep
# behavior directly (including from stderr content, the only thing that still
# distinguishes "recognized" from "merely never reaped").
#
# Kept unchanged: UAT-006 (OS junk), UAT-008/009 family and CG-001 family
# (sweep 2/5's own owner arms, unrelated to sweep 9's array removal),
# UAT-010c/d/e/f (sweep 2/5's own knobs), UAT-011d (renamed REG-004, same
# renders.json behavior), UAT-013 (renamed REG-007, same worktree-safety
# fixture with its outcome flipped from reap to survive), and the
# sweep-count-structure test.
#
# Assertion style note: per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md, non-final
# absence checks use a positive match for the bad case plus an explicit
# `return 1`, never `!`-negation; final-line absence uses `[ ! -e ... ]`.
