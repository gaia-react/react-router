# Tests for .claude/hooks/red-verify-commit-check.sh, the commit-gate half of
# mechanical TDD RED-verification.
#
# The hook denies `git commit` when a new-at-HEAD test that now passes has no
# matching valid RED on record in .gaia/local/red-ledger/<tree-key>/observations.jsonl.
# Edits/renames/refactors of tests already present at HEAD are out of scope and
# never demand a RED. The hook never re-runs tests; it is a ledger lookup plus
# a signal recompute via the shared helper.
#
# Each test builds a tmp git repo with a HEAD commit plus a staged change,
# seeds the ledger by writing JSONL directly (computing the real signal with
# the same helper the hook uses, so the match is exact), and runs the hook with
# synthetic PreToolUse JSON on stdin. The hook always exits 0; allow vs deny is
# carried in stdout: a deny emits `"permissionDecision": "deny"`, an allow
# emits nothing.
#
# The hook runs with pwd = the tmp repo so bare `git` and the helper's relative
# disk reads resolve against the staged change. In production the hook runs
# with pwd = the project root, where .claude/hooks/lib (the shared shell lib)
# and .gaia/scripts/red-ledger (the signal helper) live and resolve from pwd.
# To reproduce that pwd=root invariant, the setup symlinks those two trees from
# the home repo into the tmp repo at their repo-relative paths. The symlinked
# helper still resolves `typescript` from the home repo's node_modules via
# createRequire(import.meta.url), so the signal recompute works.
