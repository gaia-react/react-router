# .claude/hooks/provision-worktree.sh: idempotent worktree provisioning.
#
# The hook answers one question -- "is the tree this session is working in a
# linked worktree, and does it hold the state a worktree needs?" -- and repairs
# what it finds. It has three callers (SessionStart, PostToolUse/EnterWorktree,
# and worktree creation calling it directly), so the cases below are organised
# by how the tree is named rather than by which caller named it: an explicit
# argument, the EnterWorktree tool_response, the payload cwd, and the process
# cwd fallback.
#
# The typegen arm is exercised through a stub `react-router` binary installed
# at the borrowed path under the main checkout, the same proxy the concurrency
# meter's C6-03 uses. A real typegen needs the app's whole dependency tree.
#
# The install arm is exercised through a stub `pnpm` binary prepended onto
# PATH, standing in for the package manager the same way the react-router
# stub stands in for typegen: a real `pnpm install` needs registry access and
# the app's whole dependency tree, neither of which a hermetic suite has.
#
# Assertion style follows .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md: POSIX `[ ]` and
# `grep -qF`, with every non-final custom check ending in an explicit
# `return 1`.

  # first-entry positions fall out for free, where a substitution has to spell
  # each position separately.

  # stated ground that CI reaches here with no pnpm at all. That ground is

  # the environment by accident.
  # The rebuild itself lives in the shared helper, which is also where the
