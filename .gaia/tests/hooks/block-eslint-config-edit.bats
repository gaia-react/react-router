# Tests for .claude/hooks/block-eslint-config-edit.sh.
#
# The guard protects eslint.config.{js,cjs,mjs,ts,mts,cts} at any path, and what
# it does on a match is ASK: every edit to the file prompts the operator,
# whatever the edit does. So the suite has two halves and neither is decoration.
#
# The first half is the path gate, which is the only thing that decides anything:
# a file that is not an eslint config passes silently, every guarded extension at
# every depth asks. It is pinned in both directions on purpose. The extension set
# is ESLint's own `FLAT_CONFIG_FILENAMES`, so a missing member is a config the
# resolver loads and the guard ignores; and the pattern's `(^|/)` boundary is
# what keeps an ordinary source file named `my-eslint.config.mjs` out of the
# prompt, a dimension no fixture varies unless one is written for it.
#
# The second half is the reason string, and it carries more weight than a message
# usually does, because here it is the whole basis on which a human answers. The
# operator is being asked precisely because the hook cannot tell the two cases
# apart, so the reason has to hand them what the hook could not use: that the
# prompt is on the filename alone, which edit is legitimate, and where the common
# case belongs instead. Those three are pinned individually, because a reason
# that loses any one of them turns an informed confirmation into a rubber stamp.
#
# The ask cases below deliberately include both extremes, a comment-only change
# and a whole-file replacement, an added bare preset spread and an added rule
# override. They are the cases where a guard that started judging edits again
# would first diverge, and judging is what this hook exists not to do: the
# legitimate shape and the silencing shape are the same shape, so the uniform ask
# is the contract rather than a coarse approximation of one.
#
# shellcheck disable=SC2317
# SC2317 (command appears unreachable) is not intrinsic to bats, and a suite
# carrying no bare `return` inside a `@test` body reports none of it. A `@test`
# body parses as a top-level brace group rather than a function, so a bare
# `return 0` terminating one of the tests below reads as a script-level return
# and every `@test` after it looks unreachable. File-wide because that cascade
# is. shell-lint gates `.bats` at severity=warning, above SC2317's info tier, so
# the directive only quiets an ad-hoc `shellcheck -S style` run. The terminator
# that avoids it outright is the explicit `true`
# .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md prescribes. (Keep the word "shellcheck"
# off the start of a comment line here; it is parsed as a directive there.)
#
# shellcheck disable=SC2016
# SC2016 (expressions don't expand in single quotes) fires on the `$` inside
# fixture identifiers and on `${...}` inside fixture config bodies. Not
# expanding is the point: a fixture has to reach the hook as the literal text a
# real edit would carry.

# This fixture is pinned between two limits that pull in opposite directions,
# and it is the only test here that cannot use the shared helpers. Both
# constraints are load-bearing; satisfying one alone breaks it.
#
# It must be FAR ABOVE the pipe boundary. What it pins is a pipe fail-open, so
# the shape only reproduces past pipe capacity (65536) plus whatever the reader
# drains before exiting, and that second term is a property of the grep
# implementation rather than a constant: it moves by kilobytes between the two
# greps on one macOS host, and CI runs a third. A fixture tuned just above the
# local boundary passes with the defect fully restored on any reader that
# buffers more.
#
# It must also NEVER TRAVEL THROUGH ARGV, which is the constraint that bites as
# soon as the first one is satisfied. Linux caps a single execve argument at
# MAX_ARG_STRLEN, 32 pages (131072 bytes), independently of ARG_MAX, so a
# megabyte-scale payload handed to `jq --arg` never execs at all: jq dies E2BIG,
# the substitution yields nothing, the hook reads empty stdin and exits 0, and
# the test fails on the platform CI runs while passing on macOS, which has no
# per-string cap. That is a kernel limit rather than a bash-version gap, so the
# bash-5 pre-flight cannot see it either.
