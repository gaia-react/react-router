# Wiki/source conformance for the session-start janitor's sweep enumeration.
# The "## The session-start janitor" section in
# wiki/concepts/Local Working State.md must enumerate one bullet per janitor
# sweep, its stated count numeral must equal both the enumerated bullet count
# and the sweep count derived from .claude/hooks/local-janitor.sh source, and
# the outlier sweep's own documentation must name the retention knobs
# source_sweep9_knobs derives from that sweep's own paragraph in the janitor
# source, and state the maxdepth-1 scope and never-traverse zones. This
# mechanically enforces the agreement so the enumeration cannot silently
# drift when a sweep is added, removed, or renumbered.
#
# Assertion style: .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md.
