# Tests for .claude/hooks/lib/jq-availability.sh as the PreToolUse layer runs
# it: every blocking hook driven with jq off PATH, against a payload inside its
# remit and, where the hook carries binding literals, one outside it.
#
# The suite is per-layer rather than per-hook because the claim is a property of
# the layer: with no jq on PATH the fail-closed hooks refuse and the advisory
# ones stand down. A copy of these two assertions in each hook's own suite would
# be eighteen places for the claim to drift, and the arm they all reach is one
# function.
#
# WHAT A FAILURE HERE MEANS. The hook read its payload with jq under errexit and
# died at status 127, which the PreToolUse contract reads as a NON-BLOCKING
# error: the call it was written to deny proceeded, with no denial and no
# diagnostic. That is the defect the arm exists to close, and a green run of the
# hook's own suite says nothing about it, because every other test in those
# suites runs with jq present.
#
# Run under bash 5: `bash .gaia/scripts/bats5.sh .gaia/tests/hooks/jq-availability.bats`.
#
# Assertion style: bash-3.2-safe per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md.

# THE AMBIENT FIELDS ARE THE POINT, not padding. A PreToolUse payload carries
# session_id, transcript_path and cwd ahead of tool_input, and every one of the
# three is a filesystem path nobody chose for this purpose. The two below are
# built to carry every binding literal any hook here passes, as a substring, in a
# path shape a real machine could have: a "platform" directory supplies the rm
# literal, a "git-svc" one the git literal, a ".venv" the env literal, a
# "settings" the process-dump literal, and so on down to .pem, .key and
# manifest.json.
#
# So an arm matching its literals against the whole document denies every
# still-allowed case below, the jq install among them, which is the session with
# no way out the literals exist to prevent, reached by the mechanism meant to
# prevent it. These builders are what make that a red rather than a green.
#
# ONE literal is deliberately absent: `code-audit-`. block-selfheal-paths.sh
# binds on the top-level agent_type, so it scans the whole document by design and
# is correct to; poisoning the ambient fields with its literal would assert the
# opposite of that hook's contract.
