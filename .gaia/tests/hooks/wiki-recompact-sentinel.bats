# Tests for .claude/hooks/wiki-recompact-sentinel.sh.
#
# PostCompact half of the two-hook hot-cache restoration handshake. A
# PostCompact command hook cannot inject its stdout into context, so it drops a
# sentinel file instead and wiki-recompact-inject.sh (UserPromptSubmit) does the
# injection on the next turn. This hook's ENTIRE observable behavior is that one
# file: it prints nothing, it decides nothing, and it always exits 0. If it
# stops writing the sentinel, the hot cache silently never comes back after a
# compaction and there is no error anywhere to notice.
#
# The sentinel and the hot cache are both resolved relative to the working
# directory, so every scenario runs in a throwaway directory via
# `invoke_hook_in`. The hook reads no stdin, so the payload passed is empty.
