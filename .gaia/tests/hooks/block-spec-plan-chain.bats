# Tests for .claude/hooks/block-spec-plan-chain.sh.
#
# The guard stops a session that authored a SPEC from planning it: /gaia-spec
# ends with a very large context, and /gaia-plan needs a clean one, so the
# handoff is a prompt the human pastes into a fresh session. Prose alone did not
# hold (a skill-invoked /gaia-spec carries an outer goal that survives the skill
# body), so the boundary is deterministic: a stamp on the entry points every
# /gaia-spec path must run, a deny on the entry points /gaia-plan cannot avoid.
#
# The stamp is keyed on session_id, so every assertion here is really two: the
# guard fires for the session that ran /gaia-spec, and is inert for one that did
# not. The hook is best-effort, not a sandbox: it always exits 0, carrying the
# allow/deny decision in stdout JSON.
