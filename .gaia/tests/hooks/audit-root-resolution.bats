# Tests for the audit machinery's root resolution, end to end (#1055).
#
# #1055 found the audit chain deciding "which checkout am I operating on"
# independently in eight places, each answering from the ambient cwd. Option C
# (README.md FC-5) fixes it by having the CALLER anchor: each entry point `cd`s
# into the audited root once, in a subshell, before the chain beneath it runs.
# Per-site unit tests (Phase 2) prove each fixed site behaves; they cannot
# prove nothing was missed. This suite is the missed-site harness #1055 asks
# for: it drives the whole chain from a session whose OWN cwd is outside the
# audited root and asserts every stage answers for the tree it was anchored
# on, never the other one.
#
# Fixture, built once per test (setup()):
#   MAIN     a real git repo, populated with copies of the real hooks/scripts/
#            libs/roster (never symlinked), holding one committed file per
#            Code Audit Team roster member. The roster is read out of
#            .gaia/audit-ci.yml, so a member added there is a member this
#            suite drives.
#   WT       a real linked worktree of MAIN, on its own branch, with every
#            roster member's file changed to DIFFERENT content, so MAIN and WT
#            produce genuinely different per-member content digests. MAIN and
#            WT never share a `.gaia/local` (no symlink): the two clearance
#            stores stay physically separate, matching an unprovisioned
#            worktree, so a root derivation that quietly collapsed onto the
#            wrong tree is observable rather than papered over.
#   OUTSIDE  a non-repository temp directory. This is the bats process's OWN
#            cwd for every test in this file (set once in setup()).
#
# Eight stages, one per #1055 instance (README.md FC-5/FC-6, task doc table):
#   1  resolve-audit-members.sh    --root flag
#   2  resolve-audit-spawn.sh      no root argument, D-3's fail-closed guard
#   3  audit-member-digest.sh      --root flag
#   4  audit-write-clearance.sh    --root flag, subdirectory rejection
#   5  audit-stamp-trailer.sh      no root argument, caller anchors via cd
#   6  post-audit-status.sh        no root argument, caller anchors via cd
#   7  pr-merge-audit-check.sh     no root argument, caller anchors via cd,
#                                  FC-4's two independent roots
#   8  agent handshake block       AUDIT_ROOT derivation (extracted from the
#                                  agent's own fenced code block, never a
#                                  hand-maintained copy)
#
# Stages 1, 3, 4, 7 and 8 are proven live by SOURCE MUTATION: the minimal edit
# that reintroduces the ambient-cwd resolution the stage guards against,
# confirmed to turn that stage's own assertion red, then restored
# byte-identical and checksum-verified. Every mutation is applied to this
# fixture's OWN copy under $MAIN, never to the real checked-out files this
# session is running under. Stage 2's guard already reflects Phase 2's D-3;
# its mutation reintroduces the pre-D-3 fail-open shape.
#
# Stages 5 and 6 take no root argument at all (Phase 2 was explicitly
# forbidden from adding one, that is option A, ruled out in #1053), so there
# is no line inside them to mutate. Their non-vacuity control is an
# INVOCATION control instead: the same hook, anchored on MAIN instead of WT,
# must name MAIN, and the same hook with no anchor at all, from OUTSIDE, must
# decline out loud and write nothing.
#
# See README.md FC-4, FC-5, FC-6 for the frozen contracts this suite asserts
# against, and the task doc's "what 'from OUTSIDE' means" section for why
# stages 5-7 are anchored via `( cd "$root" && ... )` rather than run with a
# bare non-repository cwd.

# Prints the Code Audit Team roster, one member name per line, read out of the
# `auditors:` block of the audit-ci.yml at $1. That file is the roster's source
# of truth, so a member added there is a member this suite drives, with no
# second list to remember to grow.
#
# A line scan rather than a YAML parse, on purpose: this runs while building
# the fixture for every test in the file, and PyYAML is an optional dependency
# here in a way it is not in the suites that gate on it.
#
# The block closes on any non-blank, non-comment line starting in column 0,
# rather than on a character class that has to guess which spellings a top-level
# key can take. A close rule reading `/^[A-Za-z_]+:/` looks equivalent and is
# not: it steps over a hyphenated or digit-leading key, leaving the block open
# so that key's own `- name:` children read as roster members.
#
# The column-0 rule is a claim about THIS file, not about YAML. A block sequence
# may legally sit at its parent key's own indentation, so a roster written with
# `- name:` in column 0 is valid YAML that this scan reads as zero members. The
# caller's non-empty guard turns that into a red, and its message names both
# causes, because the scan cannot tell them apart and a reader staring at a
# populated audit-ci.yml needs the second one to make sense of it. Measured, not
# reasoned: a roster MIXING the two indentations is not valid YAML in either
# direction, so no INDENTATION choice can lose a member here while the guard
# stays satisfied.
#
# Indentation is not the only way to spell a roster, and this scan reads exactly
# one spelling: an indented `- name: X` carrying its value on the entry line. An
# expanded block entry, a flow mapping (`- {name: x}`), a quoted key, `globs:`
# written before `name:`, or a value held over to a more-indented line below the
# key are each valid YAML this scan would otherwise read short.
#
# Deliberately NOT widened to accept them. The parser the rest of the machinery
# uses, `.claude/hooks/lib/audit-scope.sh`'s _audit_scope_parse_auditors, is
# LOOSER on three readings, not equal: its member line at `:302` leads with
# `[[:space:]]*`, so a column-0 sequence reads as members there; that same line
# spells the key `name[[:space:]]*:`, so `- name : x` reads there; and the
# `unq()` it calls at `:309` (defined at `:244`) strips a quoted value this
# scan keeps verbatim. Measured on three fixtures, each confirmed valid YAML
# and two members first: that parser reads both members in all three, where
# this scan reads NONE (column-0), REFUSES (`- name : x`), or reads the name
# verbatim with its quotes still on it (`- name: "X"`).
#
# What none of them reaches is a SILENT member drop, the only failure this
# helper exists to prevent. Two are read short and stop: a column-0 roster
# drops every member and reds at the caller's non-empty guard, and `- name : x`
# reds at the count below. The third is read WRONG rather than short, so it
# satisfies the count and stops one step later, at setup()'s `cp` of a path no
# agent file has. Loud in all three.
#
# Note which way that cuts, because it is the opposite of the obvious reading:
# widening this scan toward those readings would AGREE with that parser more,
# not less. Agreement is not what earns the strictness. This helper's contract
# is that a roster it cannot read canonically stops the suite, and every
# spelling it accepts is one more that can shrink the roster instead of
# stopping it. It stays strict because stopping is the product.
#
# What that leaves is counted instead of assumed. The block's member entries are
# its shallowest `-` lines (a `globs:` item is indented deeper), so an entry that
# yields no name is an entry this scan cannot read, and the scan fails rather
# than returning the short list. Without that count the dangerous case is ONE
# off-spelled member: the list comes back shorter but non-empty, the caller's
# non-empty guard stays satisfied, and the suite drives a subset while its test
# names still say "every definition" -- the silent drop this helper exists to
# remove, reintroduced one level up.
#
# Reading a name and counting one are therefore the same act. A name counts only
# when the entry line carries a value that is not a comment, so `- name:` alone,
# a value held over to the next line, and `- name:  # deferred` each reach the
# count as an unread entry. Counting a bare `name:` key instead would satisfy
# the count while contributing an EMPTY name, which the caller's per-entry
# `[ -n "$m" ]` then drops: the short-but-non-empty roster above, arrived at
# through the check meant to forbid it.
#
# The count is what guards it, not CI. `.gaia/scripts/verify-audit-roster.sh`
# does red on every one of those spellings, but its workflow is advisory by
# design and deliberately not a required check
# (`.github/workflows/audit-roster.yml`), so it is a visible red rather than a
# merge block and cannot be leaned on here.
#
# `.claude/hooks/lib/audit-scope.sh`'s _audit_scope_parse_auditors parses the
# same block canonically and is deliberately NOT reused here: it emits a record
# per glob, so a member declaring no globs produces no record and vanishes from
# its output. Silently dropping a member is the failure this helper exists to
# remove, so the two answer different questions and both stay.

# Stage 8: the extracted agent handshake block (AUDIT_ROOT derivation).
# Instances 2, 7. The block is byte-identical across every agent
# definition (FC-5), so the positive tests below drive every one of them
# rather than pinning the default member's copy and inferring the rest. The
# mutation control below stays on code-audit-frontend.md alone: it proves the
# assertion is non-vacuous, which one file establishes, and mutating the whole
# roster would cost a backup/restore cycle per member for the same signal.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Stage 8b: the machinery a definition INVOKES, not just the root it derives.
# Stage 8 proves each definition's AUDIT_ROOT variable resolves to WT. That
# says nothing about which copy of a script the definition then runs, and the
# two came apart: the scope-digest capture is spelled
# "$AUDIT_ROOT/.gaia/scripts/audit-scope-digest.sh" while the clearance and
# findings writers were spelled as bare relative paths, so on a worktree audit
# the writer ran the SESSION ROOT's copy. Both derive over the same --root,
# but each loads its own copy's digest engine (audit-digest.sh resolves its
# siblings from BASH_SOURCE, never from --root), and this subsystem's scope
# digest is the first value the two derive points are compared FOR EQUALITY.
# A pull request editing the machinery list or the digest recipe -- the
# routine shape of work here -- would make the two disagree, refuse every
# member's earned write with a diagnostic naming a rotation that never
# happened, and deadlock the gate with no in-band recovery.
