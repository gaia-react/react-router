# Tests for .claude/hooks/pr-merge-audit-check.sh.
#
# The hook denies `gh pr merge` unless a code-review-audit signal exists for
# HEAD. Signal 5 (check_out_of_scope_pr) is a fail-closed allowlist bypass: it
# allows the merge when EVERY file the PR changes (vs its merge base with the
# default branch) lives outside audit scope; wiki/, .claude/, .specify/,
# .gaia/, docs/, and root-level markdown. Any in-scope path (app/, test/,
# configs, .github/workflows/) keeps the marker mandatory.
#
# Signal 6 (check_self_mod_only_update_pr) is a stricter sibling: it allows the
# merge when the ONLY in-scope path is .github/workflows/code-review-audit.yml
# AND its committed bytes are a verbatim re-render of the bundled template
# (.gaia/cli/templates/workflows/code-review-audit.yml.tmpl, proven by git-blob
# identity), with every other changed path out of scope. This is the self-mod-
# only case /update-gaia Step 12 produces; CI self-mod-skips such a PR so no
# GAIA-Audit stamp can land, but the changed bytes ARE GAIA's own template, not
# adopter code. Fail-closed: a non-matching workflow byte, a second in-scope
# path, or an absent template falls through to the normal deny.
#
# Every Code Audit Team marker is keyed to a member's own CONTENT DIGEST (a
# sha256 over exactly the files that member owns plus the shared gate
# machinery, folding the in-scope-but-ownerless paths into the default
# member's set), not the whole tree and not the commit. There is no
# carry-forward clearance machinery: a marker either validates for the
# CURRENT digest or it does not.
#
# Each test drives the hook exactly as the harness does: a PreToolUse JSON
# payload on stdin, run with the repo as the working directory (the hook uses
# bare `git`, not `git -C`). The hook always exits 0; allow vs deny is carried
# in stdout; a deny emits `"permissionDecision": "deny"`, an allow emits
# nothing. The in-scope (deny) cases double as a jq/setup canary: if jq were
# missing the hook would exit early with no output and those assertions would
# fail rather than false-pass.
#
# Setup models a PR: a base commit on `main`, then a `feature` branch carrying
# the change under test. merge-base(HEAD, main) resolves to the base commit, so
# the bypass diffs only the feature's files. No remote is needed; the hook
# falls back from `origin/main` to `main`.
#
# The real .gaia/scripts/resolve-audit-members.sh is copied into REPO
# (untracked, so it never appears in the diffs under test) so every case below
# exercises the hook exactly as it runs in the real repo, where the resolver
# is always present. The one test that needs the resolver-absent fallback
# removes this copy explicitly.

# The permit-diagnostic case below asserts stdout and stderr independently,
# which needs `run --separate-stderr` (bats >= 1.5.0).

# --- Linked-worktree anchoring (regression) ---------------------------------
#
# The gate spans two roots that are the SAME path in a plain checkout and
# DIFFERENT paths in a linked worktree, which is why a single-root derivation
# passes every test above and still deadlocks a real worktree merge:
#
#   store root  WHERE a clearance lives -- main-anchored (state registry
#               `audit-clearance-markers`, scope shared; provisioning
#               symlinks <worktree>/.gaia/local at main's).
#   tree root   WHAT the clearance attests to -- the ACTING tree, because the
#               content being merged is the worktree's HEAD, not main's.
#
# Every clearance writer keys on the acting tree (the agent definitions pass
# `--root "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"`, and resolve-audit-spawn.sh and
# audit-stamp-trailer.sh derive the same way). Digesting main's HEAD in the
# gate would compare a marker against content nobody is merging: no marker
# could ever match, and the deny message's own remedy ("re-spawn the agents")
# rewrites the same non-matching marker forever.

# out-of-scope bypass only when that trust is one this checkout could not have
# invented AND the base was taken against the pull request's own recorded base
# branch AND local HEAD is the pull request's recorded head AND the command
# being gated names that same pull request. Anything less denies. The first
# three conjuncts alone would not be enough: the gate scopes its range to local
# HEAD, and a synced default-branch checkout has an empty range against every
# pull request in the repository at once, while the record itself is read for
# the CURRENT BRANCH and so describes a pull request the gated command need
# never have named.
#
# The self-modification bypass reads the same base and is deliberately NOT
# relaxed: it is reachable from the member-aware gate, where it clears every
# dispatched member at once.
