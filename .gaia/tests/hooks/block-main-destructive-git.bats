# Tests for .claude/hooks/block-main-destructive-git.sh.
#
# The hook blocks commits to main/master, force-push to main/master, and any
# plain `git push` originating from main/master (PR-only flow). It fires only on
# a real `git` INVOCATION in command position; command text that merely
# mentions `git commit` / `git push` (a grep pattern, an echo string, an
# argument to another program) does not trip it. Foreign-repo commands pass via
# the shared repo-scope helper.
#
# Each test drives the hook as the harness does: a PreToolUse JSON payload on
# stdin, run with the repo as the working directory (the hook resolves the
# current branch from cwd and loads .claude/hooks/lib/repo-scope.sh relative to
# cwd). The hook always exits 0; allow vs deny is carried in stdout.

# deny code -- for every git command the hook matches. It denies on bash 5 as
# well as on 3.2, so neither case below needs a /bin/bash pin to have teeth.

# stopped enforcing, so the deny twin proves the degrade kept the main-branch
# floor. Without cmd_targets_foreign_repo the foreign-repo carve-out does not
# fire, which is the fail-closed direction this hook documents at :21-24.

# a /bin/bash run tells the fix apart from the arm it replaced. On a bash-5
# /bin/bash (Linux CI) these pass either way.
