#
# The guard denies the well-known `rm -rf` footguns (root, $HOME / ~, cwd,
# unscoped glob, .git, node_modules, --no-preserve-root) while letting the
# whitelisted scratch paths and unknown relative paths through. It is
# best-effort defense-in-depth, not airtight: it always exits 0, carrying the
# allow/deny decision in stdout JSON, and broader policy lives in
# settings.json permissions.
#
# The quoting axis is the point of this suite. `read -r -a` word-splits but
# does not remove quote characters, so a target must be matched with its
# quotes stripped: `rm -rf "$HOME"` is the *careful* way to write the
# expansion and has to be denied exactly like the bare `rm -rf $HOME`. Each
# dangerous target is therefore asserted in three shapes, bare, double-quoted,
# and single-quoted, plus the partially-quoted `"$HOME"/projects` form where
# the quotes sit inside the token rather than around it.

# and silently disarms the hooks that load their libraries by a cwd-relative path.
# A guard that whitelists a scratch directory in its relative spelling only denies

# make the rule and the guard agree.

# the repo root would need a live `git rev-parse`, which this guard deliberately
# does without, and baking a literal absolute prefix into a `.claude/`-distributed

# --- an unparseable registry lib degrades, it does not deny everything ---
#
# The guard resolves .gaia/scripts/main-root-lib.sh and state-registry-lib.sh
# off BASH_SOURCE to read the scratch whitelist, under the `set -euo pipefail`
# at :269. That errexit sits inside main(), which is a function rather than a
# subshell, so an abort there IS the hook's exit -- and exit 2 is the
# PreToolUse deny code, refusing every Bash tool call rather than the rm
# footguns alone.
#
# Expressing this needs a COPY of the hook in a tree the test controls, since
# the real $HOOK_ABS always resolves the real checkout's libs. Pinned to stock
# /bin/bash: the `|| true` arm both loads already carried survives on bash 5,
# so only 3.2 tells the fix apart from the arm it replaced.
#
# The filesystem root is the deliberate probe target. It is denied by a
# hardcoded arm that does not consult the registry at all, so the assertion
# isolates "did the hook survive the load" from "did the whitelist come back":
# an unreadable registry legitimately yields an empty whitelist, which changes
# what is ALLOWED but never what is denied here.

# Unpinned twins of the two registry cases above, and they are not redundant with
