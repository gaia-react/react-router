# Tests for .claude/hooks/worthiness-presence-check.sh, the merge-time half of
# the worthiness audit.
#
# The hook denies `gh pr merge` when an emergent test the PR changed has no
# worthiness-ledger line (.gaia/local/worthiness-ledger/<tree-key>/worthiness.jsonl)
# matching its current content. It scopes to the emergent test files this PR changed (the diff
# against the merge base with the default branch), decides emergent membership via
# the determinism classifier, recomputes each test's signal via the shared RED
# helper, and checks PRESENCE + signal match only, never the verdict. Stale-signal
# lines are rejected on recompute. It fails open on missing git/jq/node/lib/
# classifier and skips unparseable files. When zero emergent tests changed, it is
# a no-op.
#
# Setup models a PR: a base commit on `main`, then a `feature` branch carrying the
# change under test. merge-base(HEAD, main) resolves to the base commit, so the
# gate diffs only the feature's files. No remote is needed; the hook falls back
# from origin/main to main.
#
# The hook runs with pwd = the tmp repo so bare `git` resolves the staged change.
# In production pwd = the project root, where .claude/hooks/lib and .gaia/scripts
# live. To reproduce that invariant the setup symlinks those trees from the home
# repo into the tmp repo at their repo-relative paths; the symlinked helpers
# resolve `typescript` from the home repo's node_modules via createRequire.
#
# The hook always exits 0; allow vs deny is carried in stdout: a deny emits
# `"permissionDecision": "deny"`, an allow emits nothing.
