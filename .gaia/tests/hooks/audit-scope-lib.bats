# Count real invocations of a symbol in a file. A presence probe -- `type X` or
# `command -v X`, the shape a consumer uses to decide whether a guarded load
# actually defined the symbol -- names it without calling it, so it is excluded.
# The count assertions below are about invocations, and a bare grep for the name
# reads a degrade guard as a second call.
#
# The probe is stripped from the line rather than dropping the line, and counted
# per occurrence rather than per line, so `type X >/dev/null && X "$arg"` still
# counts the call it carries. Dropping the whole line reads that one-liner as
# zero invocations, which greens the "calls it once" assertion over a consumer
# that calls it twice.
#
# Counting occurrences is what makes the two other filters load-bearing, and
# per-line counting hid the need for both: comments go first, because a header
# naming the symbol twice in prose now contributes two, and the match is
# bounded by a non-identifier at BOTH ends, because `audit_scope_init` is a
# prefix of any longer name someone adds later, and because a terminator that
# demands whitespace declines every other one a real second call can carry --
# `audit_scope_init;`, a bare call at end of line -- which greens the
# calls-it-once pin over exactly the drift it exists to catch.
#
# Counted by splitting on the boundaries rather than by matching across them:
# `grep -o` CONSUMES the boundary character it matched and resumes after it, so
# two occurrences separated by exactly one non-identifier character -- the
# `audit_scope_init;audit_scope_init` spelling -- leave the second with no
# boundary left and it goes uncounted, which is the same green-over-drift the
