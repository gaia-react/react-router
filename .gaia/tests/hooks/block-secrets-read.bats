# Tests for .claude/hooks/block-secrets-read.sh.
#
# This hook carries the obligation four permissions.deny rules used to hold:
# Read(**/*.key), Read(**/*.pem), Read(**/*credential*) and Read(**/secrets/*).
# Those rules are gone because a `**` Read() deny glob arms Claude Code's
# bypass-immune deniedPathInsideDirectory circuit breaker for every directory in
# the tree, forcing a manual approval prompt on every recursive search or copy.
# The absence of all four is asserted at the bottom of this file, because a
# well-meaning re-addition of any one of them reinstates the prompt storm.
#
# The guard is heuristic defense-in-depth, not a sandbox: it always exits 0,
# carrying the allow/deny decision in stdout JSON.

# shellcheck disable=SC2317
# SC2317 (command appears unreachable) is a structural false positive on every
# @test block below: bats invokes each test body through its own runner, which
# static shellcheck cannot see, so it marks the blocks unreachable. The directive
# is file-wide because the false positive is intrinsic to the bats structure, not
# to any single test, and it masks no genuine signal: SC2317 cannot reason about
# an indirectly-invoked bats suite at all.

# Run the hook with lib/reader-operands.sh absent, to exercise the grammar-load
# failure arm.
#
# The hook is COPIED into this test's own temporary directory and driven from
# there, with no library beside it. It must never be exercised by hiding the
# real one: both read-guard suites would target the identical absolute path,
# .gaia/tests/bats-shards.sh weighs by file size and may put them in one shard
# or in two, and .gaia/tests/run-bats-parallel.sh forks every shard into ONE
# shared workspace. One shard is if anything the stronger reason rather than a
# reprieve: the pair then runs sequentially inside a single bats invocation over
# that same one workspace.
# While one suite held the library hidden, every allow-assertion in its sibling
# would see the fail-closed deny, so the pair would flake against each other and
# the concurrency-safety claim that runner makes would be false. The live
# session's own Read, Grep and Bash calls run through these same hooks and would
# be denied for the width of that window too.
#
# The hook resolves its library as `dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"/lib`, so a copy
# in a directory with an empty lib/ beside it reaches for a file that is not
# there, which is the missing-library arm exactly. The directory is created and
# left empty rather than omitted so the arm under test is the absent FILE rather
# than an unresolvable lib dir; both deny, and pinning the narrower one is what
# makes this a test of the probe instead of a test of `cd`.

# so a member added later is covered without anyone remembering to write a test
# for it, and a regression in the operand walk reds against every member rather
