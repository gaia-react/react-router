# Regression coverage for tech-debt #841: once a session has switched into a
# linked worktree, an Edit/Write/MultiEdit call whose file_path resolves to a
# *different* git worktree (most often the main checkout) is a stale
# pre-switch path applied silently, no error, because both paths are real,
# valid files on disk. This guard denies that call deterministically. It is
# a no-op outside a linked-worktree session (feature-branch mode or a plain
# checkout), and fails open on anything it cannot resolve (a target
# directory that does not exist yet, a path outside any git repository).
#
# Assertion style note: per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md, non-final
# absence checks use a positive match for the bad case plus an explicit
# `return 1`, never `!`-negation.

# .claude/skills/gaia/references/isolation.md contracts file_path as an absolute
# path with no cwd resolution, and an absolute path defeats both. The two tests
# below cover them anyway, for a reason specific to this pair: unlike the
# identically-shaped guards on the payload_cwd chain, whose unreachability rests
# on an absolute-cwd invariant THIS script enforces itself, these rest on an
# external convention the script cannot enforce. If the harness ever emits a
# relative file_path, they are the only thing standing there, and without
# coverage a future edit dropping either one regresses in silence. Both cases
# are mutation-verified: each fails against a hook with its guard removed.

# CDPATH killer. With CDPATH honored, `cd inner` resolves through CDPATH into
# the exempt audit tree instead of through the worktree's own `inner` symlink,
# so the write is waved through as shared state while git still resolves it to
# the main checkout: a deny becomes an allow. The CDPATH hit lands on a
# SUBdirectory of the exempt tree deliberately. bash echoes the resolved path to
# stdout whenever cd consults CDPATH, so the mutant's capture is two lines; only
# a match one level below the arm's own directory leaves the trailing `*` free
# to absorb the second line, which is what makes the mutant reach the exemption.

# --- library-load degradation (gaia-react/gaia#1556) ------------------------

# always resolve the real checkout's libs, where neither the absent nor the
# unparseable case can be expressed.
#
# Two ways a library goes unusable, and this fail-open guard must allow through
# both: it is gone, and it is present but does not parse (an unresolved merge
# conflict, a truncated write). Under `set -e` a failed `.` abandons the shell
# in both cases, at different cost: a file bash cannot open exits 1, an
# advisory that lets the edit through with a raw diagnostic on stderr, while
# one it cannot parse exits 2, the PreToolUse deny code, which turns this
# fail-open guard into one that blocks a legitimate edit.
#
# Both libraries get the pair, and state-registry-lib.sh is not the redundant
# half: it never fails open on its own. gaia_registry_recognizes is consulted
# from inside an `if` condition, so an undefined function reads as "no entry
# recognizes this path" and routes the write to the unregistered DENY arm.
#
# The controls are what give the four cases teeth: their assertions (exit 0, no
