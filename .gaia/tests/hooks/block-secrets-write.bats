# Tests for .claude/hooks/block-secrets-write.sh.
#
# The guard is a write-time heuristic, not a sandbox: it scans the content an
# Edit/Write/MultiEdit is about to introduce and denies four shapes of obvious
# committed secret (AWS access-key id, GitHub PAT, PEM private-key header, and a
# dotenv-style assignment to a suspicious name). It always exits 0, carrying the
# allow/deny decision in stdout JSON.
#
# The dotenv rule is the only one with an allowlist, because it is the only one
# that matches on a *name* rather than on secret-shaped material: a line whose
# name ends in _TOKEN/_SECRET/_KEY/_PASSWORD is suspicious, so the value decides.
# The allowlist therefore carries the whole weight of the rule's false-positive
# behavior, and the deny cases below are what pin down that widening it does not
# hollow it out.
#
# Writing this file is itself subject to the guard, so every secret-shaped
# fixture is concatenated at runtime from fragments that match no pattern as
# written. Do not "tidy" those into single literals; the guard will deny the
# edit that does it.

# shellcheck disable=SC2016
# SC2016 (expressions don't expand in single quotes) fires on every fixture that
# carries a `$`, which is most of them. Not expanding is the entire point: the
# fixture has to reach the hook as the literal text a real edit would contain,
# so `printf` takes it as an unexpanded argument. The directive is file-wide for
# the same reason the one above is, the fixtures are the file, and leaving it off
# buries the oracle's real output under a warning that is correct for every hit.
