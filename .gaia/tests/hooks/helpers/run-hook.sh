# Shared harness for the .gaia/tests/hooks bats suites: one quote-safe hook
# invocation, one assertion form per decision mechanism, and a re-export of
# `hook_registered`, the assertion that a hook is registered in
# `.claude/settings.json` at all, which lives in the cross-directory helper
# because suites outside this directory assert registration too.
#
# The directive below is the one thing this file needs that a suite does not:
# `status` and `output` are set by bats' own `run`, which is invisible to the
# linter here because this is a `.sh` held to the strictest severity floor
# rather than a `.bats` file (see .gaia/tests/shell-lint.sh). Scoped to the one
# code, so every other finding in this file still fires.
# shellcheck disable=SC2154
#
# Source it from `setup()`, never `setup_file()`. bats runs `setup_file` in a
# separate process, so functions defined there are invisible to test bodies:
#
#   setup() {
#     . "$BATS_TEST_DIRNAME/helpers/run-hook.sh"
#     HOOK_ABS="$(cd "$BATS_TEST_DIRNAME/../../../.claude/hooks" && pwd)/x.sh"
#   }
#
# A suite keeps its own payload-building wrapper and calls the invocation here
# to deliver it, so `run_hook`-style suite-local names never collide with these.
#
# WHY THE PAYLOAD IS POSITIONAL. `invoke_hook` passes the payload and the hook
# path as arguments to the inner `bash -c`, rather than interpolating them into
# an outer quoted string. Interpolation is not a style choice: a fixture
# carrying a quote of its own terminates the wrapper early and the hook then
# reads a DIFFERENT payload than the one the fixture spells. The hook denies for
# the wrong reason, or never parses the payload at all, and the test greens
# having proved nothing about the case it is named for.
#
# ASSERTIONS ARE NAMED FOR THE MECHANISM, not for the verdict, because the
# suites here test hooks with three incompatible decision contracts: the exit
# code carries the verdict, JSON on stdout carries it, or JSON on stdout defers
# it to the human. A generic `assert_denied` hides which contract is under test,
# and a suite that picks the wrong one asserts against a mechanism its hook never
# uses. Mechanisms 1 and 2 come as pairs; mechanism 3 is a single function,
# because a hook that asks has no allow verdict of its own to assert.
#
# Every form below is bash-3.2 safe per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md: `[ ]`
# for status and emptiness, `grep -qF` for a substring, `<positive> && return 1`
# for an absence. A bare `[[ ]]` and a `!`-negation both fail to fail on a
# non-final assertion line.

# THE TWIN, deliberately not shared. The INV-7 concurrency meter carries the
# same one-line idiom as `gaia_deliver_hook` in
# .gaia/tests/concurrency/lib/concurrency-harness.sh. The two are not merged
# because the forms below call bats' `run` themselves, which every suite here
# wants and that suite cannot use: its scenarios wrap delivery in a
# tree-scoped or environment-scoped runner, capture stdout alone, or drive a
# hook purely for its side effect. Keep the two in step by name; a change to
# the invocation below almost certainly applies there too.

# `hook_registered` is defined in the cross-directory helper rather than here,
# and re-exported by this source line, so the suites below keep calling it
# unchanged. It moved because registration is asserted from outside this
# directory too, by a suite that sources no part of this harness; leaving it
# here left such a suite no form but a hand-written predicate over the command
# spelling, which is the drift #1911 records. The helper carries the reasoning
# and the `hook-registration-lib.sh` source line the function depends on.
# Rooted at this file's own on-disk location, so it resolves however a suite is
# invoked.

# invoke_hook PAYLOAD HOOK
# Pipes PAYLOAD to HOOK, capturing status/output through bats' `run`.
invoke_hook() {

# invoke_hook_in DIR PAYLOAD HOOK

# --- mechanism 1: the exit code carries the verdict ------------------------
# The hook blocks by exiting 2 with a BLOCKED message, and allows by exiting 0
# silently. PreToolUse reads exit 2 as a block and shows the message to Claude.
# Under this contract a hook says nothing at all when it allows, so the allow
# assertion is an assertion of silence.

assert_blocked_by_exit() {
  [ "$status" -eq 2 ]
  grep -qF -- 'BLOCKED' <<<"$output"
}

assert_allowed_by_exit() {
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [ -z "$output" ]
}

# --- mechanism 2: JSON on stdout carries the verdict -----------------------
# The hook always exits 0; a deny is a `"permissionDecision": "deny"` field in
# the JSON it writes to stdout, and an allow writes no deny. A suite whose hook
# is additionally silent on an allow asserts that on top of the pair here,
# rather than trading this assertion for that one.

assert_denied_by_json() {
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  grep -qF -- '"permissionDecision": "deny"' <<<"$output"
}

assert_allowed_by_json() {
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  grep -qF -- '"permissionDecision": "deny"' <<<"$output" && return 1
  return 0
}

# --- mechanism 3: JSON on stdout defers the verdict to the human -----------
# The hook always exits 0 and writes `"permissionDecision": "ask"`, which
# prompts the operator instead of ruling. It is a separate mechanism rather
# than a third verdict under mechanism 2 because the two failure directions are
# opposite: `assert_allowed_by_json` passes on an `ask` (there is no deny in the
# output), so a suite that reached for it to mean "not blocked" would green on a
# hook that had stopped asking entirely. Assert the ask positively.

assert_asked_by_json() {
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  grep -qF -- '"permissionDecision": "ask"' <<<"$output"
}

# --- registration: is the hook wired into settings.json at all? ------------
# `hook_registered` arrives from `.gaia/tests/helpers/hook-registration.sh`,
# sourced at the head of this file, and is documented there. It is separate from
# the three mechanisms above in the same way it always was: those drive a hook
# and read its verdict, it reads the file that decides whether the hook is
# reached.
