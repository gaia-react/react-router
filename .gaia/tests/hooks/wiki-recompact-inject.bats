# Tests for .claude/hooks/wiki-recompact-inject.sh.
#
# UserPromptSubmit half of the two-hook hot-cache restoration handshake, paired
# with wiki-recompact-sentinel.sh (PostCompact). Compaction drops
# hook-injected context, including the SessionStart hot cache. On the first
# prompt after a compaction this hook re-injects wiki/hot.md by writing it to
# stdout, which UserPromptSubmit adds to the model's context, then clears the
# sentinel so it fires exactly once.
#
# Three separate silent failures live here, and each has a test below: never
# firing (no injection at all), firing forever (the sentinel is never
# consumed), and consuming the sentinel without delivering. None of them is
# visible in normal use -- the hook exits 0 either way.
#
# The sentinel and the hot cache both resolve relative to the working
# directory, so every scenario runs in a throwaway directory via
# `invoke_hook_in`.
