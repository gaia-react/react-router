# Tests for .claude/hooks/block-lockfile-edit.sh.
#
# A lockfile is generated, never hand-written: an edited pnpm-lock.yaml is
# routinely inconsistent with the manifest it claims to lock. The guard denies
# Edit / Write / MultiEdit whose target BASENAME is `pnpm-lock.yaml`, at any
# depth and under any prefix, and abstains on everything else.
#
# WHY THE ABSTAIN CASES CARRY THEIR WEIGHT HERE. This guard's failure mode is
# silent in both directions and the deny is the loud half: the hook always
# exits 0, so a broken match prints nothing, blocks nothing, and lets the edit
# it exists to stop simply succeed. Nothing observable changes. So the deny
# cases below prove the guard fires and the abstain cases prove it is a match
# rather than a blanket, which together make the guard demonstrably able to
# fail rather than assumed working.
