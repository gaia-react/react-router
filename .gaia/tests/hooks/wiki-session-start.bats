#
# SessionStart hook with two jobs, both pure side effect and neither of them
# ever reported: record HEAD into $GIT_DIR/claude-session-start so the Stop
# hook can diff against the session's starting point, then hand off to the
# bounded working-state janitors. It writes nothing to stdout, decides nothing,
# and always exits 0.
#
# The stamp is the load-bearing half. If it stops being written, the Stop hook
# loses its baseline and wiki commits made during the session go undetected --
# with no error, no output, and nothing that distinguishes it from a session
# that genuinely changed no wiki page. The delegation tests below cover the
# other half: the janitors must run when present and must not be able to fail
# the session when they break.

# install_hook: copy the hook under test into $REPO at its own repo-relative

# the stamp.
#
# The delegation tests need this and the stamp tests do not, because the hook
# locates both janitors from its OWN directory (`${BASH_SOURCE[0]}`) rather
# than from the working directory. Invoking $HOOK_ABS with cwd set to $REPO
# therefore runs the real janitors out of the home checkout and never sees a
# stub placed in the fixture, which reads as a pass for the fail-open tests and
# as a failure for the witness tests. Running a copy makes the fixture the
# hook's own tree, so a stub is what it finds; that the copy resolves its
# delegates beside itself, in whichever tree it was invoked from, is the
# property the rooting buys and these tests are what pin it.
