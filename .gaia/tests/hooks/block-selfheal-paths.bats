# Tests for .claude/hooks/block-selfheal-paths.sh, the LOCAL producer's
# self-heal repair-boundary gate (FC-10).
#
# The gate binds MEMBERS, not the tree: a PreToolUse payload carries
# `agent_type` only when the hook fires inside a subagent call, so this hook
# no-ops for the main session / orchestrator (absent agent_type) and for any
# non-Code-Audit-Team subagent, and denies only a `code-audit-*` member
# editing (via Edit/Write/MultiEdit or a well-known Bash write vector) a path
# matched by the ONE refusal set in .claude/hooks/lib/audit-selfheal-paths.sh
# -- the same set the CI producer's push gate sources
# (.github/workflows/code-review-audit.yml). The guard is best-effort, not
# airtight: Bash vectors are unbounded, so only the well-known write shapes
# (redirect, tee, sed -i, sponge, cp/mv destination) are covered, mirroring
# block-manifest-write.sh's own stated posture. It always exits 0, carrying
# the allow/deny decision in stdout JSON.

# --- the test surface INSIDE app/, the member's own repair surface ---

# app/** is code-audit-frontend's repair surface and stays repairable, but the
# vitest suite and the Chromatic stories that would catch a bad app/ repair
# live inside it. Refusing app/ whole is not available here the way it is for
# test/, so this half of the refusal set is written per shape, derived from the
# two collectors that decide what actually gates a merge. Each shape below is
# driven on its own; the enumeration is hand-written because no single artifact
# holds it, so each entry carries the collector it comes from:
#
#   app/**/tests/**       -- the convention .claude/rules/coding-guidelines.md
#                            pins (tests and stories in a tests/ subfolder),
#                            refused whole the way test/ is, so a fixture or a
#                            shared helper beside the assertions is covered too
#   app/**/*.test.ts(x)   -- vitest.config.ts `test.include`, which collects on
#                            the suffix and not on the directory, so a suite
#                            outside a tests/ folder still runs and still gates
#   app/**/*.stories.tsx  -- .storybook/main.ts `stories`, the glob Chromatic
#                            snapshots, and Chromatic is a required merge check
#
# Deliberately NOT members: app/**/*.stories.ts (the Storybook glob is .tsx
# only, so a .ts file by that name snapshots nothing), and app/** source
# generally, which is the repair surface the member exists to fix.

# is a fail-open: the refused edit goes through undenied. The refusal cannot
# route through `deny`, which builds its JSON with jq, so it takes the
# exit-code contract instead -- which is why these three assert through
# `assert_blocked_by_exit` / `assert_allowed_by_exit` while every test above
# asserts through the JSON pair.

# Mirror every PATH directory that provides jq into a shim without it, rather
# than dropping the directory: jq sits in /usr/bin on the CI runners, beside
# the bash, grep and cat both the hook and these assertions still need. Only
# the "does this directory provide it" question is shared
# (.gaia/tests/helpers/path.sh); that file's header keeps the rebuild shape
