# Tests for .claude/hooks/block-serena-cross-tree-activation.sh.
#
# Serena is registered without --project-from-cwd, so an agent must call
# activate_project explicitly, by name or by absolute path. A bare NAME
# resolves through Serena's own machine-global registry to whichever checkout
# first registered it; .serena/project.yml is tracked, so every linked
# worktree of this clone carries the SAME name, and the registry answers with
# the main checkout regardless of which tree the session is acting in. This
# guard denies the activation call before that silent wrong-tree binding can
# happen, in both the name and the path form.
#
# Assertion style note: per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md, non-final
# absence checks use a positive match for the bad case plus an explicit
# `return 1`, never `!`-negation.

# --- library-load degradation (gaia-react/gaia#1556) ------------------------
# These run a COPY of the hook staged inside the tmp repo, so the .gaia/scripts
# it resolves off BASH_SOURCE is one the test controls. Running $HOOK_ABS would
# always resolve the real checkout's libs, where neither the absent nor the
# unparseable case can be expressed.
#
# Two ways the resolver goes unusable, and this fail-open guard must allow
# through both: it is gone, and it is present but does not parse (an unresolved
# merge conflict, a truncated write). Under `set -e` a failed `.` abandons the
# shell in both cases, at different cost: a file bash cannot open exits 1, an
# advisory that lets the activation through with a raw diagnostic on stderr,
# while one it cannot parse exits 2, the PreToolUse deny code, which turns this
# fail-open guard into one that blocks a legitimate activation.
#
# The controls are what give the two cases teeth: their assertions (exit 0, no
# deny) are equally satisfied by a hook that adjudicates nothing at all, so each
# interpreter gets a control proving the same staging still DENIES.
