#!/usr/bin/env bash
# shellcheck shell=bash
#
# whole-tree-invariants.sh: run, as one named set, every check whose input is
# the whole tree. Exit 0 when every member passes, 1 when any member fails, 2
# on a usage error. Run it from the repository root:
# `bash .gaia/tests/whole-tree-invariants.sh`.
#
# Why this exists. Pre-dispatch self-verification selects checks by the paths a
# diff touches, and a whole-tree checker has no path that selects it -- its
# input is the directory. So the set that actually ran was whichever a
# currently-loaded rule happened to name, and rule activation is itself
# path-scoped: structurally the wrong shape for a check whose input is the
# whole tree. The cost when one is missed is a full audit round, because the
# repair commit moves HEAD, rotates every dispatched member's content digest,
# and buys a re-audit of each.
#
# This deliberately duplicates work CI already does. That is the point: CI
# finds it after the push, which costs the round above, and the pre-dispatch
# step exists to front-load exactly that.
#
# Membership is decided by two questions, read from each candidate's own header
# rather than inferred from its name. The first accounts for every exclusion
# but one: is the input the whole tracked tree, with no path-scoped trigger
# that could select it? The second exists for exactly one member so far: a
# candidate that answers yes to the first question can still be excluded on
# cost, when its standalone wall clock is long enough that no per-PR aggregate
# should absorb it inline. `.gaia/scripts/check-hook-capabilities.sh` is that
# member; its own dedicated gated CI job runs it against the live tree instead,
# and its WTI_EXCLUDED reason line carries the measured figure that earned it
# the exclusion. The candidates that answer no to either question are listed in
# WTI_EXCLUDED below with their reason, so a reader can see they were
# considered rather than missed, and .gaia/tests/lib/whole-tree-invariants.bats
# fails if a candidate appears in neither table. That suite sweeps the five
# `.sh` naming families that have produced a member (`check-*`, `audit-*-
# complete`, `lint-*` and `verify-*` under .gaia/scripts/, plus .gaia/tests/*.sh),
# rather than `check-*` alone: five members live outside that one glob. The
# `.bats` family is deliberately not swept even though WTI_BATS names a member
# from it, because the only glob that would reach it, .gaia/tests/lib/*.bats,
# enumerates every ordinary suite in that directory and would need an exclusion
# entry per suite saying nothing. The one bats member is named directly instead.
#
# Runtime, measured on the tree at the time of writing: the WTI_SCRIPTS members
# total ~48s, of which shell-lint.sh is ~18s and
# check-script-capabilities.sh ~16s (it walks the invocation closure of every
# allowlisted script), and the shard suite ~36s; the whole set measures
# ~83-86s end to end. Every figure here is a tilde against host load, and the
# spread between two honest samples on different hosts is a couple of seconds
# a member, so treat a small disagreement as noise and re-measure rather than
# reconciling it. Time each member the way this script invokes it, the
# WTI_SCRIPTS members with `bash <path> >/dev/null </dev/null` and the
# WTI_BATS member with `bats <path>`, and time the aggregate by running this
# script. Running `bash` at the bats member is not merely wrong-and-loud: its
# `local` declarations fail outside a function, so the body's paths expand
# unrooted and it attempts a write at `/` before dying on a syntax error.
# That is why there is one tier rather than a fast default plus a
# named slower tier. A split is worth its second name only once the honest
# set is slow enough that people skip it, and an aggregate slow enough to
# skip is worse than none; a minute and three-quarters against the price of
# an audit round is not that.
# Re-measure the WHOLE paragraph, not the figure being edited. Only the member
# COUNT below is machine-checked, so every number here decays independently:
# the shard suite's own figure nearly doubled as its W10 fixtures grew across
# two rounds of one change, and the scripts half sat ~19s low for long enough
# that the stated parts could no longer reach the stated whole. A component
# figure nobody re-measured is the one that misdirects, because it reads as
# current beside the ones that were.
#
# The staleness lever: nothing above used to notice a member added without
# this figure catching up, which is exactly what happened here (this comment
# said "fifteen" while WTI_SCRIPTS already held sixteen). main() checks
# WTI_SCRIPTS's live count against WTI_SCRIPTS_COUNT_ASOF below and refuses to
# run when they disagree, so adding or removing a member forces this paragraph
# to be re-visited rather than drifting unnoticed again.
#
# What the lever does not catch, stated so it is not mistaken for more than it
# is: only WTI_SCRIPTS_COUNT_ASOF is machine-checked. The runtime paragraph
# above therefore names the member set rather than restating its cardinality in
# prose, so there is no second, unchecked copy of the count left to drift
# against the checked one; and a member swapped for another, or simply
# grown, holds the count, so the runtime figures can go stale with the lever
# satisfied.
#
# No member is ever skipped. A missing member path, and a bats member with no
# `bats` on PATH, both count as failures rather than passing quietly, because a
# member that silently drops out reproduces the defect this script exists to
# end.
#
# Members are invoked from the current directory, so run it from the repository
# root. That is also what lets the sibling bats suite exercise the aggregation
# against a fixture tree of stubs instead of paying the real cost, the
# end-to-end figure stated once in the runtime paragraph above rather than
# restated here: two copies of one measurement is two things to keep current,
# and the stale one reads as authoritative.
