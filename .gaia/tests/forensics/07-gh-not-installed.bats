# UAT-013: when gh is not installed, save locally only with a one-line note,
#          exit zero, do not attempt any gh invocation.
#
# DETECTOR/SURROGATE TEST (not the shipped skill): exercises an inline surrogate
# of the runbook branch and, where used, the `lib/*.sh` mirrors, never the shipped
# skill body. Real end-to-end guard: integration.md "Local skill end-to-end" diff.

# No-gh surrogate
#
# Simulates the runbook's gh-not-installed branch (forensics.md § 8):
#   - Detects gh absent via command -v
#   - Writes the report locally
#   - Prints one-line note
#   - Returns zero (never errors)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Synthetic stand-in for `bash .gaia/scripts/main-root-lib.sh --tree-key`'s
# stdout (16 lowercase hex characters); this surrogate never invokes the real
# resolver, same as the fixed synthetic $timestamp below.
