# UAT-015: a feature composes with the read-side .env guard without weakening
# it. Both tests assert the guard's content: what the settings file carries, and
# the hooks that back it.
#
# The guard's MECHANISM changed and the invariant did not. Read-side denial no
# longer lives in permissions.deny at all: any Read() rule there arms Claude
# Code's bypass-immune approval breaker, which forces a manual prompt on every
# search and copy command whose target it cannot statically prove safe. The
# obligation moved to two hooks for the tool tier and to
# sandbox.filesystem.denyRead for the subprocess tier that a Read() rule used to
# reach by merging into the sandbox boundary. So the assertions below pin the
# ABSENCE of every Read() rule where they once pinned five present ones, and a
# re-addition reds here.
