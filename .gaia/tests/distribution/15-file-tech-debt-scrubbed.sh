#
# Marker-strip SEMANTIC coverage: exercises a marker-bearing, adopter-facing
# skill (`file-tech-debt`) against the bundle-SCRUBBED staging tree and
# asserts the scrubbed prose is still complete enough for an adopter-side
# agent to finish the recipe. 03-marker-strip.sh proves the markers are
# gone STRUCTURALLY (no fragments survive, every marker-bearing file
# shrank, none to zero bytes); it does NOT prove a load-bearing STEP did
# not sit inside a stripped block. This scenario closes that gap for the
# sharpest case: `file-tech-debt` is a recipe an adopter agent follows
# literally, and it carries a `gaia:maintainer-only` block.
#
# `/gaia-wiki lint` was the other candidate but does NOT exercise this gap:
# the `gaia-wiki` skill files staged for it carry ZERO markers, so scrubbed
# == unscrubbed there. `file-tech-debt` is the only adopter-facing skill
# whose scrubbed shape actually differs.
#
# TWO parts, deliberately split:
#
#   1. DETERMINISTIC, side-effect-free, GATING (always runs, no Docker):
#      on the scrubbed skill, assert the maintainer-only block is gone AND
#      the load-bearing adopter steps survived. If a future scrub over-
#      strips (removes a step the adopter path needs), this fails at PR
#      time, which is exactly the release-time-only gap #899 closes. This
#      is the checkable, side-effect-free post-condition; it gates.
#
#   2. ADVISORY model probe (Docker + CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN gated, NEVER
#      gates): drive `claude --print` in the container against the scrubbed
#      tree to reproduce the dedup key from the scrubbed skill text, and log
#      whether it succeeded. Like the wiki-sync scenarios this depends on
#      free-form model output, so it is observational only: a miss logs a
#      warning and the scenario still passes. The scenario's exit code is
#      governed solely by part 1.
#
# NO EXTERNAL SIDE EFFECTS. `file-tech-debt` normally files a real GitHub
# issue via `gh`. This scenario never reaches that sink: (a) the probe
# prompt instructs the model to answer from the skill text and stop before
# any `gh` command; (b) the Layer-2 image has no `gh` binary and no GitHub
# auth, so a create is not possible; (c) docker.sh bind-mounts the staged
# tree READ-ONLY, so no write to the tree is possible either.
#
# Note on the deviation from a pure "gate the whole scenario behind
# Docker+token" shape: a deterministic, Docker-free, side-effect-free
# semantic-survival assertion exists, so it is used as the gate and runs in
# every lane (PR included). The free-form model drive stays Docker+token-
# gated and strictly advisory, matching the wiki-sync non-gating posture.
