#
# Adopter-flow regression: runs `gaia ping` (all three events plus the
# argument-parsing error and help paths) against the bundled CLI binary in
# a staged release tree. `gaia ping` is the shared adoption-ping entry the
# `/gaia-init`, `/setup-gaia`, and `/update-gaia` skills fire; it had zero
# bundled-binary coverage anywhere before this scenario.
#
# Why it exists: the ping handler and its `postPing` core are bundled into
# the single-file `.gaia/cli/gaia` by esbuild. A bundling defect (a
# tree-shaken module, a broken import that resolves in source but not in
# the bundle) would reach adopters on their very first `/gaia-init`, and no
# test in the release path exercises it. This runs the real bundled binary.
#
# NO NETWORK. Every ping call sets GAIA_TELEMETRY_PING_DISABLE=1, the
# documented suppression switch (`gaia ping --help`): `postPing` returns
# before it reads the project id, the manifest, or opens a socket, so the
# scenario is self-contained and fires no real telemetry.
#
# Asserts:
#   init / setup / update events  exit 0, no stdout (fire-and-forget).
#   --event bogus                 exit 1 (invalid enum).
#   (no --event)                  exit 1 (--event is required).
#   --event init --mode nonsense  exit 1 (invalid field enum).
#   --help                        exit 0, usage banner on stdout.
#
# Layer 0.5: runs on the host or runner, no Docker. Cheap (~1s after
# build-staging); no pnpm install.
