# Layer 2: validates the Claude-in-Docker plumbing for distribution tests.
# Builds the gaia-dist-claude image, mounts a staged release tree at /work
# read-only, and runs `claude --print` with an OAuth token from the host env.
#
# What this DOES test:
#   - Docker image builds (Node + claude.ai/install.sh + correct PATH).
#   - `claude --version` runs inside the container (binary reachable).
#   - CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN authenticates against Anthropic from the
#     container; `claude --print` returns a real model response.
#   - The staged tree is reachable as the container's working directory.
#
# What this does NOT test:
#   - Adopter flows like /gaia-init or /setup-gaia. Those exercise interactive
#     skills and live in follow-up scenarios; this is the harness smoke.
#   - Token-attribution to subscription vs. API. That is the diagnostic
#     runbook's job; see `diagnostic/claude-auth-in-docker.md` for the
#     verified $0/run finding on Claude Max hosts.
#
# Skipped automatically when Docker is unavailable OR
# CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN is unset, so contributors without auth can still
# run Layers 0 + 1 via run-all.sh.
