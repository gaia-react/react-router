# Phase 2; Scrub-wiki. Resets wiki/hot.md and wiki/log.md to release-
# baseline state. release.yml does NOT do this; it runs in the local
# `/gaia-release` runbook BEFORE the release PR is merged. We replicate
# it against the staging tree so the harness mirrors what an adopter
# receives in a published tarball, regardless of which source-commit
# state we built from.
#
# This MUST precede the scrub leak-check below. The scrub's
# `maintainer-audit-members` / `monorepo-prefix` leak checks scan
# `wiki/**`, and a mid-development `wiki/log.md` carries sync-log entries
# that name maintainer-only surfaces (`code-audit-maintainer-*`, sibling
# `studio/` / `website/` paths). At a release tag those sentinels are
# already baseline (the runbook reset them pre-tag), so release.yml's
# leak-check never sees them; on an arbitrary branch they are still live.
# Resetting first lets the leak-check see the same adopter-shaped tree the
# tarball ships, so the harness is green on any branch instead of tripping
# on log content the adopter never receives.
