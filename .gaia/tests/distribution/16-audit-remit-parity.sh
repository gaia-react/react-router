#!/usr/bin/env bash
# 16-audit-remit-parity.sh
#
# Proves the roster-derived remit invariant and its repair hold on the
# release-scrubbed ADOPTER shape, not only on the maintainer tree. Runs
# after task-docs-and-wiring's .gaia/release-exclude and wiki marker-pair
# edits are already committed (Phase 5), so the staging build it reads
# from the working copy reflects them.
#
# Assertions, in order:
#   1. The bundle carries the writer (.gaia/scripts/write-audit-remits.sh).
#   2. The writer is not release-excluded (source .gaia/release-exclude).
#   3. The writer's manifest class equals the check's (staged manifest).
#   4. The check exits 0 on the scrubbed, marker-stripped tree.
#   5. The staged roster is the adopter shape: exactly two members, neither
#      maintainer-only, and no code-audit-maintainer-*.md ships.
#   6. No shipped region names a glob belonging to a stripped member
#      (UAT-010).
#   7. The bundled writer repairs a drifted shipped definition byte-exact
#      (UAT-012).
