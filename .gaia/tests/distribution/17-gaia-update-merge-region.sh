#
# Adopter-flow regression: runs `gaia update merge-region` against the
# bundled CLI binary in a staged release tree. `merge-region` is the
# region-aware verdict oracle the `/update-gaia` skill invokes for a
# declared generated region inside an owned file, masking the region on
# each of the three merge sides so a divergence confined to it never reads
# as adopter drift.
#
# Why it exists: `update merge-region` is on every adopter's upgrade path
# (any release that declares a generated region), and it runs OUT OF THE
# STAGED RELEASE TREE rather than the adopter's already-installed binary
# (the `/update-gaia` skill resolves it as
# "$LATEST_DIR/.gaia/cli/gaia" update merge-region, never the working-tree
# copy, so a run whose installed binary predates the command can still
# reach it). That resolution rule is unobservable at any layer below this
# one: an in-process unit test exercises the same source tree the running
# process was started from, never a downloaded release copy.
#
# Read-only: `merge-region` never writes a file, it only emits a JSON
# verdict, so no scaffold copy is needed beyond the staged binary itself.
# The fixture files are synthetic, written to a scratch dir.
#
# Layer 0.5: runs on the host or runner, no Docker, no pnpm install.

# A second `/update-gaia` run cannot reach the merge walk at all once
# `.gaia/VERSION` is bumped, so this is the only layer that can observe a
# re-invocation against the post-update state.
#
# Two independent properties, and the first is why this scenario is not a
# restatement of scenario 5. Scenario 5 establishes that the function is stable
# across two calls on the PRE-update inputs; repeating that on a different set
# of inputs adds no failure mode. What is only observable here is the VERDICT:
# once the working copy equals the release copy, the same three sides resolve to
# `already-latest` rather than to scenario 1's `no-adopter-drift`, which is the
# state every adopter's tree is left in and the one a re-run must recognize.
#
# Scenario 1's baseline and latest are READ here, deliberately: the contrast
# with scenario 1 is the point, same two sides, a different `current`, a
# different verdict. Reading them is also what scenarios 5 and 7 already do.
#
# What this scenario must not do is WRITE one. A `cp` over `s1-current.txt`
# is safe only for as long as nothing below that line reads it for its
# pre-update content, so any scenario later inserted above, or any reordering
# of this file, silently gets post-update content and passes for the wrong
# reason. The post-update state therefore lands in its own `s6-current.txt`
# and every `s1-*` file is left exactly as scenario 1 wrote it.

# directive to the two lines that earn it keeps the rule live everywhere else,
# and the single-quoted `node -e` body in scenario 3 is why that matters: a
# later edit writing `'$FIXTURES/x'` inside it expecting shell expansion is an
# SC2016 hit worth seeing, and a file-wide disable would swallow it silently.
