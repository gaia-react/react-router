# bats-shards.sh: deterministic, discovery-based file-level sharder for this
# repo's bats suites, one matrix leg per shard.
#
# .github/workflows/audit-ci-tests.yml's `shards` job matrix calls `run
# <shard-id>` once per bats leg. `.gaia/tests/lib/bats-shards.bats` (this
# script's own guard suite) and `.gaia/tests/lib/audit-ci-shards.bats` (the
# workflow's guard suite) call `shards` and `files <id>` to prove the
# partition and the directory seam.
#
# Maintainer-only. `.gaia/tests` is wholesale release-excluded via
# `.gaia/release-exclude`, so this never reaches an adopter.
#
# Usage:
#   bash .gaia/tests/bats-shards.sh shards              # shard ids, in order
#   bash .gaia/tests/bats-shards.sh files <shard-id>     # that shard's .bats paths
#   bash .gaia/tests/bats-shards.sh group <shard-id>     # its exchange group's ids
#   bash .gaia/tests/bats-shards.sh run <shard-id>       # bats those paths, one invocation
#   bash .gaia/tests/bats-shards.sh -h | --help
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  success (shards/files listed, or run's bats invocation passed)
#   1  run's bats invocation failed
#   2  usage error, unknown shard id, a shard resolving zero files, a pinned
#      hook not found in HOOKS_DIR, a SCRIPTS_COST_OUTLIERS entry not found in
#      the resolved SCRIPTS_TESTS_DIR, or more anchored files than the group
#      has shards
#
# Why discovery over a checked-in file manifest: a manifest goes stale the
# moment a .bats file is added, and it fails SILENTLY -- the new file runs in
# no shard, the check greens, the pass count quietly drops. Assigning over a
# fresh directory listing puts every new file in a shard automatically. The
# zero-files rule below is what keeps an empty directory from lying the same
# way in the other direction: a green "all passed" over zero work.
#
# Assignment rules: hooks-1 is the pinned list below; HOOKS_GREEDY_IDS split
# the rest of HOOKS_DIR by weight, SCRIPTS_IDS split SCRIPTS_TESTS_DIR the same
# way; audit and lib are their whole directories; misc is FORENSICS_DIR plus
# STATUSLINE_DIR combined.
#
# Exchange groups, which `group <shard-id>` reports. A shard's group is the set
# of ids a file can move BETWEEN without anyone editing this script: the two
# weighted groups exchange files among their own buckets on every size change,
# and every other shard is a group of one, because its files are selected by
# name (hooks-1) or by whole directory (audit, lib, misc) and no reshuffle can
# move one across that boundary. A caller that must stay correct across
# reshuffles asks about the group rather than the shard; the apt step in
# .github/workflows/audit-ci-tests.yml is the one that does.
#
# Why weight rather than count. A shard's cost is the sum of its files'
# runtimes, and file COUNT is a poor proxy for that: per-file setup dominates
# per-test work here, so one 22-second file holds 185 @test and another holds
# 1. Counting files therefore leaves shards that are even in files and lopsided
# in minutes, and the local wall clock is the slowest shard.
#
# SIZE IN BYTES is the better proxy a pure discovery pass can compute, and it
# is a proxy rather than an identity. Timed one file at a time across
# SCRIPTS_TESTS_DIR it predicts runtime at r=0.43 over that group as it stands
# and at r=0.73 with SCRIPTS_COST_OUTLIERS set aside, so it is sound for the
# ordinary members and blind to exactly the files that list names. Anchoring
# those is what covers the gap; the weight itself stays bytes for every file.
#
# Size is read from the tree at discovery time, which is what keeps this pure
# discovery. A checked-in table of per-file runtimes would be a better proxy
# still, and it would reintroduce exactly the stale-manifest hazard this
# script's whole design rejects: a new file would weigh nothing, and nothing
# would say so. SCRIPTS_COST_OUTLIERS is not that table and does not reopen the
# hazard: it carries no runtimes and changes no file's weight, it decides which
# BUCKET a named file takes, and a file it does not name weighs its bytes as
# before rather than weighing nothing. A name it carries that discovery does
# not return is an error rather than a silent no-op, which is the half the
# rejected table could not offer.
#
# Directory seam: six variables below, each independently overridable from
# the environment. A value beginning with `/` is used AS-IS; any other value
# resolves against the repo root this script derives for itself, never
# against $PWD. This lets the guard suite drive every shard with an absolute
# mktemp -d tree without a $PWD-relative default silently prefixing it under
# the real repo root.
#
# Portability: runs on CI bash 5 and macOS /bin/bash 3.2.57. No mapfile, no
# declare -A, no ${var^^}, no wait -n, no eval. Every list is LC_ALL=C sorted
# so ordering never depends on the invoking locale.
#
# Every array expansion below is written ${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"} rather than
# "${arr[@]}", which is not style: on bash 3.2 an EMPTY array expanded bare
# under `set -u` aborts with `arr[@]: unbound variable`. A seam directory that
# resolves zero .bats files hits exactly that, and the script would exit 1 on
# an unbound variable instead of taking the documented fail-closed exit 2 path
# below, defeating the zero-files guard. bash 5 does not reproduce it, so the
# guard suite is blind to the class; .gaia/scripts/lint-hook-array-guard.sh is
# the repo's detector for it.

# Cost floor, not correctness: a file-level sharder cannot split one file, and
# local-janitor.bats is the heaviest file in the hooks suite (83 @test, each
# doing a full git init plus a bare origin plus a push), so it anchors hooks-1
# alone rather than folding into the weighted split with the rest of
# HOOKS_DIR. An array so a future maintainer can pin a second file and add a
# fifth hooks shard without archaeology.
#
# It is also half of the partition's floor. This one file runs about 150
# seconds and the whole AUDIT_TESTS_DIR shard runs about the same, and neither
# splits further, so no arrangement of the weighted groups takes the slowest
# shard below that. Group sizes are chosen against that floor rather than
# against each other; `wiki/decisions/Sharded CI Test Matrix.md` carries the
# measurements and why the groups stop where they do.
PINNED_HOOKS=(local-janitor.bats)

# The scripts group's cost outliers: suites whose runtime lives in what they
# INVOKE rather than in what they contain, which is the one thing a byte weight
# cannot see. Each of these drives a whole-tree gate per assertion, so its cost
# tracks the size of the tree it sweeps and not the size of its own text, and
# the weight below reads it as an ordinary file of that many bytes.
#
# The drift is measured, not asserted. Timed one file at a time across the
# whole group, a file's size predicts its runtime at r=0.43 with these two in
# and at r=0.73 with them out, so the proxy is sound for the other 108 suites
# and wrong for exactly these. They also dominate: two of 110 files carry 37
# percent of the group's wall clock, and the next suite behind them costs less
# than a quarter of either.
#
# What that combination breaks is the partition, not the estimate. Weighed by
# bytes these two are unremarkable, so which bucket each lands in is decided by
# the packing of everything around them, and a tree change anywhere in the
# group can move them together. That draw is what reds the leg: co-located they
# exceed .github/workflows/audit-ci-tests.yml's per-shard cap and the job is
# cancelled with no failing assertion. Naming them here holds them in distinct
# buckets so no draw can produce it, which is what splitting one of them into
# halves could not do on its own -- a split divides the text, and the cost
# stayed with the half that kept the whole-tree runs.
#
# Membership rule for a future maintainer: a suite belongs here when its cost
# is dominated by an external command it runs per test, and it does NOT belong
# here merely for being slow or large. A suite left out weighs its bytes, which
# is today's behaviour and degrades no further; the ordering below decides
# which bucket each named suite anchors, so keep the list shorter than
# SCRIPTS_IDS. `wiki/decisions/Sharded CI Test Matrix.md` carries the
# measurements.
