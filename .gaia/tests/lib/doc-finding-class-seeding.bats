# Doc-grep coverage for the seeded language-neutral holistic finding
# classes and the restored workflow bucket. The set the four full-vocabulary
# members are swept against is FULL_SLUGS in setup(); group C pins it jointly
# with FRONTEND_ONLY_SLUGS against HOLISTIC_FINDING_CLASSES in
# .gaia/cli/src/schemas/finding-class.ts, so what reds on a seeded or retired
# class is the union, and the split between the two lists stays
# hand-maintained. Naming the members a second time here would be a copy
# nothing reds on. Five member sidecar contracts each carry a
# `## Holistic class assignment` section with one assignment line per class in
# their owning set, plus each canonical tie-break sentence separating a class
# that member assigns from its nearest neighbour, verbatim. One side assigned
# is enough: the prose member carries TB-1 because it assigns
# uncoupled-restatement and has to be steered off hollow-assertion, which it
# does not assign.
# `code-audit-github-workflows.md` carries a second `## Workflow class
# assignment` section for the four `workflow/*` classes.
#
# The same instruction is duplicated across the member definitions by design;
# this suite is the deterministic check keeping the copies in step with the
# schema instead of trusting hand edits to stay aligned. Every grep target
# below is extracted-section-scoped (never whole-file, except where a test
# says otherwise) and ground-truthed against the real source text before
# being written, the same discipline doc-countability-prose.bats documents.
