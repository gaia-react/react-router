# Structural guard for .github/workflows/audit-ci-tests.yml's fan-out shape:
# a matrix job (`shards`) plus a thin aggregator (`audit-ci-tests`) that
# carries the declared-required check name. This is the workflow-shape half of
# what .gaia/local/plans/PLAN-014/SUMMARY.md's `## Guards` section describes;
# most of the W-numbered checks below guard a constraint that page lays out for
# this workflow, since breaking any one of them wedges every pull request. That
# page is under `.gaia/local/`, which is gitignored, so it is absent on a fresh
# clone and this pointer resolves only where the plan was run. The range is
# deliberately unbounded here: several checks postdate that page and guard
# surfaces it never named, so a bounded list would be a count this file has to
# keep in step with itself. Each check's own header says what it guards.
#
# Every test drives its check through a helper that takes the workflow's path
# as an argument, never a predicate written inline against the live file, so
# the adversarial fixture for each test exercises the SAME code against a
# doctored copy. That is the reasoning .gaia/scripts/tests/retrigger-
# reachability.bats gives for its own workflow_timeout_gaps: a predicate that
# only ever runs against the healthy file has every branch it takes be the
# passing one, so a broken predicate still reports green.
#
# Assertion style per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md: no bare mid-test
# [[ ... ]], no `!`-negated non-final assertion, POSIX [ ] / grep -q /
# explicit `return 1`.
#
# Maintainer-only. `.gaia/tests` is wholesale release-excluded via
# `.gaia/release-exclude`, so this never reaches an adopter.

# The workflows this guard reads are a precondition on CI, not a maybe: the
# job that runs this suite checks the repo out whole, so an absent path means
# the file was renamed and this guard silently stopped guarding. So the CI
# branch FAILS instead of skipping, matching the sibling suites' own gate.

#                         unwraps to its one value, so the one-path-per-line

#                         mapping shape. A mapping with no values, or with
#                         more than one, exits 2 naming the offending entry

#                         Exits 2 when the job has no such step or the step

#                         entry prints its key, so the change-type key
#                         `codefilter` discards survives for a reader that
#                         needs it. A mapping entry carrying several
#                         change-type keys

#                         so a call site added later is reached by
#                         construction rather than by remembering to add it
#                         here.
#   aggok <job-id>         'yes' when EVERY entry in that job's own `needs:`

#                         without its comparison reds. 'no' on a job with an

# The adversarial cases that doctor a list-bearing workflow line read the line
# out of the workflow with the two helpers below rather than restating it. Both
# of those lists are packing decisions, not settled constants: the hooks legs
# are a weighted split, so adding tests to any suite can move it onto a
# different leg, and the apt gate's leg list moves with it. A restated search
# line makes every such repack a five-site edit, four of them here.
#
# Deriving it costs an independence worth naming, because that is the reason to
# think twice. A restated line cannot silently agree with a wrong workflow, and
# a drifted copy makes replace_line no-op, which reds the case rather than
# greening it. Both helpers hold that direction: sole_line_matching fails when
# its pattern stops matching or starts matching twice, and assert_doctored
# fails when the transform leaves the line untouched. The diagnostic is what
# differs -- each helper names the drift, where a silent no-op reports a failed
# invariant and leaves the reader to work out that the fixture, not the
# workflow, is stale.
#
# What derivation does NOT reach is the guards' own independence. W6 and W10
# each compare the workflow's list against a set derived from the sharder or
# the suites, and those comparisons stay untouched. An adversarial case only
# has to prove its check reds on a doctored input, which never requires it to

# W10. The apt step's shard list stays equal to the set of legs that actually
# draw a suite needing zsh or a YAML parser. W9 pins the sandbox leg's EMPTY
# package set; this pins the reduced set on the legs that do get one, which is
# the other half of the same argument: a per-shard package list is safe only
# while something recomputes it from the suites. Both dependencies fail
# asymmetrically, which is why this is a checked invariant rather than a
# comment. zsh-gated tests `skip` silently, so a leg that lost zsh reports a
# clean green having asserted nothing; the parser-gated suites fail loudly
# under GITHUB_ACTIONS, so a leg that lost python3-yaml reds. Only the first is
# invisible, and it is the one a round-robin reshuffle causes.
#
# Detection is deliberately over-inclusive rather than exact. Four patterns,
# matched anywhere in a file including inside an adversarial fixture that only
# prints the string: `command -v zsh` and `require_yaml_parser` catch a suite
# using the established gates, and `zsh -c` and `import yaml` catch one that
# reaches for either dependency without them, which is the case that would
# otherwise go undetected. An over-match adds a package to a leg that did not
# need it, which costs seconds; an under-match silently retires a suite's
# assertions. Cost is the acceptable error here and silence is not.
#
# Bare `python3` is deliberately NOT a pattern, even though W9 uses it for the
# sandbox leg. python3 itself is preinstalled on the runner; the package this
# step installs is PyYAML, and a great many suites here shell out to python3
# for structural JSON reads that need no YAML at all. Matching it would put
# nearly every leg back on the list and undo the narrowing entirely.
#
# What is compared against the workflow is the needing legs ROUNDED UP TO
# WHOLE EXCHANGE GROUPS, not the needing legs themselves. The raw per-leg set
# is a function of the sharder's weighted assignment, so it moves whenever any
# suite in a weighted group changes size, with no semantic relationship to the
# packages: exactly one suite in the whole hooks directory reaches for either
# dependency, and its leg moved three times on one branch because an unrelated
# suite beside it grew (#1554). Every one of those moves reds this check and
# buys a workflow edit that changes nothing about what the suites need.
#
# A group is the set of legs a file can move between without anyone editing
# the sharder, which `bats-shards.sh group` reports and its own S14 proves is a
# partition. Rounding the set up to whole groups is therefore stable under
# every reshuffle and moves only when a suite's dependency really changes,
# which is the event worth an edit. It costs one apt on the legs of a needing
# group that hold no needing suite themselves -- the same over-inclusive
# direction this scan already prefers, for the same reason: an over-match costs
# seconds, an under-match silently retires a suite's assertions.
#
# The comparison stays exact EQUALITY rather than relaxing to "declared is a
# superset of needed". Relaxing would also absorb the churn, and it would give
# up the other half of the check with it: a gratuitously listed leg, or the
# whole list widened back to every shard, would then read as clean. Rounding up
# keeps both halves, because the closure is a derived set with one right value.

# W12. Every gaia-setup-node step in EVERY workflow is capped with an integer
# literal that fires before its job's own cap.
#
# The apt step already carries `timeout-minutes: 6` and says why in so many
# words -- "Sized for fast failure and honest attribution" -- so the reasoning
# was in this file before this check was. What was missing was anything that
# holds a NEW call site to it: W5 caps jobs and says nothing about steps, and
# a step with no cap runs until the job's 13-minute cap fires, which reds
# `Audit CI Tests` (a declared-required context) with a generic job-timeout
# message rather than an error attributed to the install.
#
# That gap is not hypothetical. gaia-react/gaia#1762 was filed against the two
# uncapped call sites this file then held; by the time it was drained a third
# had been added, uncapped, in the same shape. Enumerating the sites from the
# `uses:` value, rather than from a list of step names, is what makes the next
# one reachable without an edit here.
#
# The reach used to stop at this workflow, and that scope was itself the
# defect: `setupnodecaps` walked `$WORKFLOW` alone, so the same composite action
# invoked from any other workflow was outside what this check could report, and
# W5, the sibling that does run tree-wide, asserts a cap per JOB and says
# nothing about steps. Call sites across the other workflows sat uncapped
# behind that gap until gaia-react/gaia#1793 drained them. So the subject set
# is now every file in `.github/workflows/`, derived in `setup()` from the
# directory, and the reach tests below assert that derivation rather than
# trusting it: no workflow in the index is missing from it, and call sites are
# actually read across more than one file. Re-pinning the check to a single
# workflow reds them, which is what makes this widening durable rather than a
# repair of the instance.
#
# Enumerating steps from the `uses:` value and workflows from the directory are
# the same move applied to the two axes this check can be narrowed on. Neither
# is a convenience: each is what keeps a site added later reachable without an
# edit here, and a check narrowed on either axis reports clean over what it
# never opened.
#
# The cap must also be strictly under its job's cap. A step cap at or above
# the job's can never fire first, so it reads as a bound while buying none of
# the attribution that is the whole point.
#
# Every fixture below passes ONE doctored copy of this workflow rather than the
# whole scanned set, and the predicate is variadic so that still drives the same
# code the check runs. Doctoring one file inside the real set would leave the
# other workflows' healthy steps in the read, which is fine for the gap arms but
# would silently defeat the empty-set arm, whose whole subject is a read that
# came back with nothing in it.
#
# The step-cap fixtures below doctor by full-line equality on
# `        timeout-minutes: 5`, which every one of these steps carries at the
# same indentation, so each of those fixtures breaks all of them at once. That
# is W5's own fixture style and it is sufficient here: the check reports the
# whole set and reds on any member, so breaking the set proves the same branch
# a single member would. The eight-space indent is what keeps the pattern off
# the four-space job-level `timeout-minutes: 5`, which belongs to
# `hook-capabilities-live-tree` rather than to any step.
#
# The rest of the fixtures pin other literals, because the arms they drive are
# not about a step's own cap: the owning-job fixture deletes the four-space
# `    timeout-minutes: 13` the steps' own job declares, and the empty-set and
# normalization fixtures rewrite the `uses:` line. A maintainer repairing stale
# pins after the workflow moves owes every one of those literals, not the step
# cap alone.
#
# A stale pin fails closed, by two different routes. A fixture asserting a gap
# gets it structurally: a no-op `delete_line` / `replace_line` leaves the
# doctored copy equal to the original, so the predicate answers for the healthy
# file and the arm the fixture asserts never fires. The normalization fixture
# asserts the HEALTHY outcome, which a no-op doctoring also produces, so it
# cannot get that for free and compares the two files itself.
#
# Every fixture drives `setup_node_cap_gaps`, the same predicate the check
# itself calls, rather than re-reading `setupnodecaps` and re-deciding in its
# own body. There is one adversarial fixture per gap outcome that predicate can
# produce, each grepping the gap string only its own arm emits; the
# normalization fixture drives the same predicate and asserts the clean outcome
# instead, so it greps nothing. That is this file's own header rule at the top,
# and the reason for it is exact here: a predicate
# written inline in the `@test` body runs only against the healthy workflow,
# where every branch it takes is the passing one, so weakening the comparison
# or gutting an arm leaves the whole set green.
# `workflow_timeout_gaps` in .gaia/scripts/tests/retrigger-reachability.bats is
# the shape being copied.

#
# The arming scan's frozen rules, reimplemented in Python rather than shared
# with the script, so W16's recomputation is a second implementation and not
# the script's own code read back. Discovery: every suite in <units-file>; each
# suite directory's helpers/, lib/ and fixtures/ subtrees, recursively and
# with no include filter, symlinks skipped as `grep -r` skips them; and the
# concurrency seam's suites and its lib/ subtree. Attribution: a suite to its
# shard, a subtree file to every shard holding a suite in that directory, a
# concurrency-seam file to the concurrency leg.
#
#   inputs   one `<kind><TAB><path>` line per input file
#   w18      the input files W18 reads: every one except a fixtures/ file that
#            is not shell by extension or shebang, which a suite reads as data
#            rather than runs to build a path
#   table    one `<page>|<armed legs>` row per class member: the union of the
#            exchange groups holding a file that names the page by full path
#            or bare basename, fixed-string, plus the group holding this suite
#            (rule 5); every leg when no file names the page, or when the
#            namer-of-all rule leaves it no namer (rule 7). ARMING_STATS, when
#            set, receives the discovery counts.
#
# Inputs through the environment: ARMING_CONC_DIR, ARMING_CONC_LEG, and for
# `table` also ARMING_CLASS, ARMING_LEGS and ARMING_ROOT.

# W16 (SPEC-078 lever two; discharges UAT-009 and UAT-019, and holds UAT-011).
# The arming script narrows a pull request that touches only the `wiki/` pages
# the `code:` filter names to the legs holding a file that names one of them.
# Nothing else stops a suite from starting to name such a page on a leg the gate
# does not arm, which is exactly the silent green the narrowing exists to risk,
# so this pins the map three ways: the declared table in w16_declared_table, a
# recomputation from the tree (arming_recompute), and the script's own answer
# for each page alone on every leg (arming_script_table). Each is compared with
# the declared table as exact set equality in both directions: an unarmed leg
# holding a namer reds, and so does a gratuitously armed one.
#
# The declared table is the one checked-in list the design permits, the W10
# shape: a list a both-ways equality check recomputes and compares. It is not
# redundant with the other two sides, and the reason is what this check can and
# cannot see. A mention added to a suite in a temp tree is seen identically by
# the recomputation and by the script, so a tree doctoring can never red those
# two against each other. The declared table does not move with the tree, which
# is why the adversarial cases below doctor the table and the script rather than
# the tree.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH. If the script, the recomputation and the declared
# table all implement the same wrong rule, all three agree. The table was
# written from the script's measured answers, so it inherits the script's answer
# on the day it was written: its value is regression detection, not initial
# correctness. Initial correctness rests on the script's driven observations and
# on a verification pass that drives each guard here into its failing state.
#
# The class comparison is the one genuinely two-implementation check: the
# script's awk reader against PyYAML, reading the same workflow. It is also what
# makes a new `wiki/` entry in `code:` a visible event: the class grows, the
# class comparison still holds, and the table comparisons red until the new
# page gets a row.
#
# The script's answers are gathered through memo_sharder, whose header carries
# why that substitutes nothing the script decides. The recomputation, the
# pagination lane and the degraded-input lanes below run the real sharder.

# W18 (SPEC-078 lever two, UAT-010). The arming scan finds a page by literal
# mention, so a suite reaching a narrowable page through a path it builds at
# run time is invisible to it, and invisible here means a leg that stops
# arming for a page one of its suites reads. This fails on a `wiki/`-rooted
# path whose remainder below `wiki/` is not fully literal, a `$VAR`, `${VAR}`
# or `$(...)` segment or a `*`, `?` or `[`, in a suite or helper the scan reads,
# and only where the remainder could match a narrowable page.
#
# Exempt, each for a stated reason. A variable PREFIX before a literal remainder
# (`"$ROOT/wiki/concepts/GAIA Audit.md"`): the scan matches by basename, so it
# sees it. A single-quoted token: nothing expands inside single quotes, so the
# text is a pattern or an allowlist rather than a path a suite builds. A
# `@test` name and a comment: neither builds a path. A fixtures/ file that is
# not shell: a suite reads it as data rather than runs it, and the literal scan
# already reaches whatever it names.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH. The reader is shell-shaped and tracks quotes one
# line at a time, so a path assembled across lines, or by another language's
# string operations inside a program a heredoc embeds, reads as literal or not
# at all.
