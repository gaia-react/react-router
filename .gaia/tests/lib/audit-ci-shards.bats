# Structural guard for .github/workflows/audit-ci-tests.yml's fan-out shape:
# a matrix job (`shards`) plus a thin aggregator (`audit-ci-tests`) that
# carries the declared-required check name. This is the workflow-shape half of
# what .gaia/local/plans/PLAN-014/SUMMARY.md's `## Guards` section describes;
# most of the W-numbered checks below guard a constraint that page lays out for
# this workflow, since breaking any one of them wedges every pull request. That
# page is under `.gaia/local/`, which is gitignored, so it is absent on a fresh
# clone and this pointer resolves only where the plan was run. The range is
# deliberately unbounded here: several checks postdate that page and guard
# surfaces it never named, so a bounded list would be a count this file has to
# keep in step with itself. Each check's own header says what it guards.
#
# Every test drives its check through a helper that takes the workflow's path
# as an argument, never a predicate written inline against the live file, so
# the adversarial fixture for each test exercises the SAME code against a
# doctored copy. That is the reasoning .gaia/scripts/tests/retrigger-
# reachability.bats gives for its own workflow_timeout_gaps: a predicate that
# only ever runs against the healthy file has every branch it takes be the
# passing one, so a broken predicate still reports green.
#
# Assertion style per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md: no bare mid-test
# [[ ... ]], no `!`-negated non-final assertion, POSIX [ ] / grep -q /
# explicit `return 1`.
#
# Maintainer-only. `.gaia/tests` is wholesale release-excluded via
# `.gaia/release-exclude`, so this never reaches an adopter.

# The workflows this guard reads are a precondition on CI, not a maybe: the
# job that runs this suite checks the repo out whole, so an absent path means
# the file was renamed and this guard silently stopped guarding. So the CI
# branch FAILS instead of skipping, matching the sibling suites' own gate.

#                         two adjacent tabs into one delimiter and every later
#                         field binds one position early. Enumerated from the
#                         `uses:` value rather than from a list of step names,
#                         so a call site added later is reached by
#                         construction rather than by remembering to add it
#                         here.
#   aggok <job-id>         'yes' when EVERY entry in that job's own `needs:`

#                         value, else 'no'. Derived per entry rather than
#                         pinned to one leg, so an entry joining `needs:`
#                         without its comparison reds. 'no' on a job with an
#                         empty `needs:`, so the coverage claim can never
#                         pass over an empty set.

# The adversarial cases that doctor a list-bearing workflow line read the line
# out of the workflow with the two helpers below rather than restating it. Both
# of those lists are packing decisions, not settled constants: the hooks legs
# are a weighted split, so adding tests to any suite can move it onto a
# different leg, and the apt gate's leg list moves with it. A restated search
# line makes every such repack a five-site edit, four of them here.
#
# Deriving it costs an independence worth naming, because that is the reason to
# think twice. A restated line cannot silently agree with a wrong workflow, and
# a drifted copy makes replace_line no-op, which reds the case rather than
# greening it. Both helpers hold that direction: sole_line_matching fails when
# its pattern stops matching or starts matching twice, and assert_doctored
# fails when the transform leaves the line untouched. The diagnostic is what
# differs -- each helper names the drift, where a silent no-op reports a failed
# invariant and leaves the reader to work out that the fixture, not the
# workflow, is stale.
#
# What derivation does NOT reach is the guards' own independence. W6 and W10
# each compare the workflow's list against a set derived from the sharder or
# the suites, and those comparisons stay untouched. An adversarial case only
# has to prove its check reds on a doctored input, which never requires it to
# know what the healthy list says. The transform stays written out at each
# case, because which mutation is being made is the part each case is about.

# W10. The apt step's shard list stays equal to the set of legs that actually
# draw a suite needing zsh or a YAML parser. W9 pins the sandbox leg's EMPTY
# package set; this pins the reduced set on the legs that do get one, which is
# the other half of the same argument: a per-shard package list is safe only
# while something recomputes it from the suites. Both dependencies fail
# asymmetrically, which is why this is a checked invariant rather than a
# comment. zsh-gated tests `skip` silently, so a leg that lost zsh reports a
# clean green having asserted nothing; the parser-gated suites fail loudly
# under GITHUB_ACTIONS, so a leg that lost python3-yaml reds. Only the first is
# invisible, and it is the one a round-robin reshuffle causes.
#
# Detection is deliberately over-inclusive rather than exact. Four patterns,
# matched anywhere in a file including inside an adversarial fixture that only
# prints the string: `command -v zsh` and `require_yaml_parser` catch a suite
# using the established gates, and `zsh -c` and `import yaml` catch one that
# reaches for either dependency without them, which is the case that would
# otherwise go undetected. An over-match adds a package to a leg that did not
# need it, which costs seconds; an under-match silently retires a suite's
# assertions. Cost is the acceptable error here and silence is not.
#
# Bare `python3` is deliberately NOT a pattern, even though W9 uses it for the
# sandbox leg. python3 itself is preinstalled on the runner; the package this
# step installs is PyYAML, and a great many suites here shell out to python3
# for structural JSON reads that need no YAML at all. Matching it would put
# nearly every leg back on the list and undo the narrowing entirely.
#
# What is compared against the workflow is the needing legs ROUNDED UP TO
# WHOLE EXCHANGE GROUPS, not the needing legs themselves. The raw per-leg set
# is a function of the sharder's weighted assignment, so it moves whenever any
# suite in a weighted group changes size, with no semantic relationship to the
# packages: exactly one suite in the whole hooks directory reaches for either
# dependency, and its leg moved three times on one branch because an unrelated
# suite beside it grew (#1554). Every one of those moves reds this check and
# buys a workflow edit that changes nothing about what the suites need.
#
# A group is the set of legs a file can move between without anyone editing
# the sharder, which `bats-shards.sh group` reports and its own S14 proves is a
# partition. Rounding the set up to whole groups is therefore stable under
# every reshuffle and moves only when a suite's dependency really changes,
# which is the event worth an edit. It costs one apt on the legs of a needing
# group that hold no needing suite themselves -- the same over-inclusive
# direction this scan already prefers, for the same reason: an over-match costs
# seconds, an under-match silently retires a suite's assertions.
#
# The comparison stays exact EQUALITY rather than relaxing to "declared is a
# superset of needed". Relaxing would also absorb the churn, and it would give
# up the other half of the check with it: a gratuitously listed leg, or the
# whole list widened back to every shard, would then read as clean. Rounding up
# keeps both halves, because the closure is a derived set with one right value.

# W12. Every gaia-setup-node step in EVERY workflow is capped with an integer
# literal that fires before its job's own cap.
#
# The apt step already carries `timeout-minutes: 6` and says why in so many
# words -- "Sized for fast failure and honest attribution" -- so the reasoning
# was in this file before this check was. What was missing was anything that
# holds a NEW call site to it: W5 caps jobs and says nothing about steps, and
# a step with no cap runs until the job's 13-minute cap fires, which reds
# `Audit CI Tests` (a declared-required context) with a generic job-timeout
# message rather than an error attributed to the install.
#
# That gap is not hypothetical. gaia-react/gaia#1762 was filed against the two
# uncapped call sites this file then held; by the time it was drained a third
# had been added, uncapped, in the same shape. Enumerating the sites from the
# `uses:` value, rather than from a list of step names, is what makes the next
# one in THIS workflow reachable without an edit here.
#
# The reach used to stop at this workflow, and that scope was itself the
# defect: `setupnodecaps` walked `$WORKFLOW` alone, so the same composite action
# invoked from any other workflow was outside what this check could report, and
# W5, the sibling that does run tree-wide, asserts a cap per JOB and says
# nothing about steps. Call sites across the other workflows sat uncapped
# behind that gap until gaia-react/gaia#1793 drained them. So the subject set
# is now every file in `.github/workflows/`, derived in `setup()` from the
# directory, and the reach tests below assert that derivation rather than
# trusting it: no workflow in the index is missing from it, and call sites are
# actually read across more than one file. Re-pinning the check to a single
# workflow reds them, which is what makes this widening durable rather than a
# repair of the instance.
#
# Enumerating steps from the `uses:` value and workflows from the directory are
# the same move applied to the two axes this check can be narrowed on. Neither
# is a convenience: each is what keeps a site added later reachable without an
# edit here, and a check narrowed on either axis reports clean over what it
# never opened.
#
# The cap must also be strictly under its job's cap. A step cap at or above
# the job's can never fire first, so it reads as a bound while buying none of
# the attribution that is the whole point.
#
# Every fixture below passes ONE doctored copy of this workflow rather than the
# whole scanned set, and the predicate is variadic so that still drives the same
# code the check runs. Doctoring one file inside the real set would leave the
# other workflows' healthy steps in the read, which is fine for the gap arms but
# would silently defeat the empty-set arm, whose whole subject is a read that
# came back with nothing in it.
#
# The step-cap fixtures below doctor by full-line equality on
# `        timeout-minutes: 5`, which every one of these steps carries at the
# same indentation, so each of those fixtures breaks all of them at once. That
# is W5's own fixture style and it is sufficient here: the check reports the
# whole set and reds on any member, so breaking the set proves the same branch
# a single member would. The eight-space indent is what keeps the pattern off
# the four-space job-level `timeout-minutes: 5`, which belongs to
# `hook-capabilities-live-tree` rather than to any step.
#
# The rest of the fixtures pin other literals, because the arms they drive are
# not about a step's own cap: the owning-job fixture deletes the four-space
# `    timeout-minutes: 13` the steps' own job declares, and the empty-set and
# normalization fixtures rewrite the `uses:` line. A maintainer repairing stale
# pins after the workflow moves owes every one of those literals, not the step
# cap alone.
#
# A stale pin fails closed, by two different routes. A fixture asserting a gap
# gets it structurally: a no-op `delete_line` / `replace_line` leaves the
# doctored copy equal to the original, so the predicate answers for the healthy
# file and the arm the fixture asserts never fires. The normalization fixture
# asserts the HEALTHY outcome, which a no-op doctoring also produces, so it
# cannot get that for free and compares the two files itself.
#
# Every fixture drives `setup_node_cap_gaps`, the same predicate the check
# itself calls, rather than re-reading `setupnodecaps` and re-deciding in its
# own body. There is one adversarial fixture per gap outcome that predicate can
# produce, each grepping the gap string only its own arm emits; the
# normalization fixture drives the same predicate and asserts the clean outcome
# instead, so it greps nothing. That is this file's own header rule at the top,
# and the reason for it is exact here: a predicate
# written inline in the `@test` body runs only against the healthy workflow,
# where every branch it takes is the passing one, so weakening the comparison
# or gutting an arm leaves the whole set green.
# `workflow_timeout_gaps` in .gaia/scripts/tests/retrigger-reachability.bats is
# the shape being copied.
