# Adversarial suite for .gaia/tests/bats-shards.sh, the discovery-based file
# sharder .github/workflows/audit-ci-tests.yml's matrix legs call to decide
# which .bats files each shard runs. The invariant that matters is that
# `shards` + `files <id>` together form a partition of the discovered file
# set: every file in exactly one shard, no shard empty, no file lost. A
# regression here is silent everywhere else -- a dropped file simply never
# runs again, every shard still greens, and the declared-required check still
# reports success having covered less than it used to.
#
# S1/S2/S3 independently re-discover the six directories rather than asking
# the script to grade its own homework, and the adversarial fixtures (A1-A3)
# mutate a scratch copy of the script to prove those checks can actually fail,
# following the discipline .gaia/tests/lib/run-bats-parallel.bats sets for its
# own F1/F2 fixtures. S9 and A4 cover the second invariant the partition has to
# hold: the weighted groups are split by weight, not by file count, and the
# partition checks are blind to that on their own.
#
# Assertion style per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md: no bare mid-test
# [[ ... ]], POSIX [ ] and grep only, so a broken assertion still fails on
# macOS bash 3.2.
#
# Maintainer-only. `.gaia/tests` is wholesale release-excluded via
# `.gaia/release-exclude`, so this never reaches an adopter.

# S13's allowlist: a tracked .bats file that no shard resolves, paired with
# the runner that does execute it. Four tab-separated fields per row: the path
# prefix, the file to look in, the LITERAL text that invokes the runner, and a
# human label for the failure message.
#
# A row's prefix must not reach further than its runner does, and the trailing
# slash is what says how far: allowlist_row_covers below matches a row ending
# in `/` by prefix and every other row by exact path. Two rows name a directory
# because their runner takes the whole of one: sandbox/run-all.sh globs
# `"$HERE"/*.bats`, and the forensics delegation runs a directory. The
# concurrency row names a full file path instead, because meter-gate.sh pins
# `SUITE="$HERE/concurrency.bats"` rather than globbing; matched as a prefix
# it would excuse a second suite added beside that one while nothing ran it,
# reproducing the silent green this test exists to catch, inside the waiver.
#
# The needle is carried per row rather than derived from the prefix, and that
# is the difference between a check and a decoration. A derived needle is
# whatever the prefix happens to spell -- `sandbox`, `concurrency` -- and those
# words appear throughout the workflow's prose, `concurrency:` being a
# top-level GitHub Actions key that is present no matter what. Such a grep
# cannot fail: delete both matrix legs AND their run: steps and it still
# matches, so the row would go on excusing every suite behind that prefix,
# which is the exact regression this test exists to catch. The invocation
# line is the thing that disappears when the runner does, so it is what gets
# matched.

# S13. Every tracked .bats file is executed by something.
#
# The sharder's own partition checks (S1-S3) prove the shards agree with a
# re-discovery of the SIX SEAM DIRECTORIES. That is a closed loop: a .bats
# file in a seventh directory is outside both sides of the comparison, so
# every one of those assertions passes while nothing runs the file. The check
# greens, the suite never executes, and a regression in it merges.
#
# The blind spot is every directory outside the seam. Most of `.gaia/tests/`
# is outside it, and so is anywhere else in the repo a suite might land, so a
# suite dropped into one of them is unreached while every assertion above
# stays green.
#
# So this compares the shard union against `git ls-files`, the repo's own
# answer to "what .bats files exist", rather than against a re-listing of the
# same six directories. Anything in the first set and not the second is an
# orphan unless the allowlist above names its runner.
#
# Scope, honestly: this proves a file is REACHED, not that its assertions are
# armed on the right pull requests. A suite in a shard whose guarded source is
# missing from the workflow's `code:` filter still skips on the change that
# breaks it; workflow-filter-coverage.bats (.gaia/scripts/tests/) is the guard
