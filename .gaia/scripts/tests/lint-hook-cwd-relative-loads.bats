# SC2016 is intentional file-wide: every fixture body is single-quoted precisely
# so the `$` expansions inside it reach the fixture file as literal text. An
# unrooted path versus a `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}`-rooted one IS the distinction under
# test, so letting this shell expand one would delete the evidence.
# shellcheck disable=SC2016
#
# Tests for .gaia/scripts/lint-hook-cwd-relative-loads.sh: the static gate that
# flags a hook locating framework code by a bare repository-root-relative path,
# which resolves against the process working directory rather than against the
# hook checkout, so a single `cd` makes a moved working directory
# indistinguishable from a missing library and buys the fail-open written for
# the missing one.
#
# THIS SUITE IS THE BLOCKING RUNNER. shell-lint.sh invokes the gate a second,
# advisory way, but a gate run against a tree that is already clean reports
# clean whether its predicate works or not, so a broken predicate is
# indistinguishable from an honest tree there. Every test below drives the gate
# against a fixture tree shaped one way at a time.
#
# Three jobs. Prove the detector fires on each position the gate header
# enumerates; prove it stays quiet on every shape the header lists as
# deliberately not a hit, which for this gate includes the repair it advertises,
# since a gate that reds on its own advice cannot ship; and assert the real
# scanned tree is clean so a regression fails CI.
#
# The quiet tests carry more weight here than in a sibling gate, because this
# class is spelled the same way in code and in the prose that documents it. Each
# of the three context trackers (heredoc bodies, multi-line double-quoted
# strings, comment words) has a test naming the construct it protects, and the
# tree carries a live instance of each: without them the gate would red on the
# operator-facing deny messages that quote the very repair it recommends.
#
# One test is load-bearing beyond coverage. "reds against the historical
# red-verify-commit-check shape" carries the exact line gaia-react/gaia#1854 was
# filed against, so the gate is proven to reach the instance it was written for
# rather than a tidied stand-in.
#
# Assertion style: bash-3.2-safe per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md.
#
# The gate resolves its scan surface with `git ls-files` relative to cwd, so
# every fixture is a real git repository with its files added.
