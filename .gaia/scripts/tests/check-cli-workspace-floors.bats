# Tests for .gaia/scripts/check-cli-workspace-floors.sh: the gate that reports a
# security floor which has stopped being applied in a pnpm workspace root the
# repository's dependency machinery never opens.
#
# The parity arm is what these tests mostly exercise, because it is the arm that
# can be proved offline. The advisory arm shells out to `pnpm audit` against a
# real registry, so the suite pins the contract around it -- that it is
# skippable on request, that its absence is reported rather than swallowed --
# and leaves the network behaviour to CI.
#
# The quoting fixtures are not defensive padding. Both sides of the comparison
# exist in the live tree today and they disagree on spelling: the workspace file
# writes `'cosmiconfig>js-yaml'` quoted, because the key contains a `>`, while
# the lockfile pnpm generates writes the same key bare. A comparison that comes
# out of this file byte-wise reports a phantom mismatch on a tree that is
# correct, which fails in the noisy direction and gets the gate switched off.
#
# Assertion style: bash-3.2-safe per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md.
