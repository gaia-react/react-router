# SC2016 is intentional file-wide: the fixture writer below is single-quoted
# precisely so the command-substitution form in a registration reaches the file
# as literal text, which is what makes it a fixture of the real spelling rather
# than of what this shell would expand it to.
# shellcheck disable=SC2016
#
# Conformance suite for `GAIA_HOOK_NAME_RE` in
# .gaia/scripts/hook-registration-lib.sh -- the one spelling of a hook name
# inside a registration command -- driven through both of its consumers:
# `gaia_pretooluse_hooks` in the same file, which reads it with `grep -oE`, and
# `hook_registered` in .gaia/tests/helpers/hook-registration.sh, which reads it
# with jq's `match` builtin.
#
# WHY BOTH CONSUMERS ARE DRIVEN. They read one literal through two different
# regex engines and each drops the trailing terminator its own way, so a change
# that repairs one and not the other is green in whichever half the author
# happened to run. The gates that source the library
# (lint-hook-advisory-classification.sh, lint-hook-jq-availability.sh) reach the
# literal only through `gaia_pretooluse_hooks`, so the live-tree test at the
# bottom re-verifies them rather than driving each one separately here.
#
# Run under bash 5: `bash .gaia/scripts/bats5.sh .gaia/scripts/tests/hook-registration-lib.bats`.
#
# Assertion style: bash-3.2-safe per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md.

# The coverage half. Narrowing the literal fails in the direction of resolving
# FEWER hooks, and the two gates that source the library judge every hook they
# reach through `gaia_pretooluse_hooks`, so a hook the literal stops resolving
# is a hook they stop judging. The expected set is derived from
# .claude/settings.json by a rule that does not share the literal -- the text
# after the last `/.claude/hooks/` in each PreToolUse command, up to the quote
# that closes it -- so the two agree only while the literal terminates at the
# path token. An empty derivation is a failure here rather than a vacuous pass.
