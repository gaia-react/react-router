# Tests for .gaia/tests/shell-lint.sh: the whole-tree guards the deterministic
# local shell gate folds in (.gaia/scripts/lint-*.sh), and the concurrent
# linter harness those passes run alongside. Each detector's own
# correctness is covered by its own suite; this one covers the wiring.
#
# The gate's bash-3.2 parse pass, its `--only` flag, and its argument parsing
# live in the sibling suite .gaia/scripts/tests/shell-lint-bash32.bats, split
# out along the seam the gate itself has -- `--only bash32-parse` names that
# pass precisely because it is separable from everything here.
#
# Why two files rather than one. A shard's cost is the sum of its files'
# runtimes and the sharder assigns whole files, so a suite that outruns the
# group's ~150s floor becomes an irreducible leg that no repartition can
# relieve; one file holding every gate run here reached the 13-minute cap in
# .github/workflows/audit-ci-tests.yml and was cancelled (#1619). The seam is
# the gate's own, not an arbitrary cut: a test belongs here if it drives the
# gate's whole run, and there if it drives the pass `--only` can select.
#
# The split divides the text and not the cost, which is worth knowing before
# reaching for it again. The whole-tree runs stayed here, so this half remains
# far above that floor while the sibling sits well under it, and the two are
# nowhere near an even division. What the split bought is a smaller unit for
# the sharder to place, not a cheaper one; what keeps this file off the same
# leg as the group's other cost outlier is SCRIPTS_COST_OUTLIERS in
# .gaia/tests/bats-shards.sh, which anchors each of them to a bucket of its own
# rather than letting the byte weight decide. Lowering the number here means
# reducing how many times the tests below re-drive the whole-tree gate.
#
# The shellcheck binary is stubbed with an always-clean, pinned-version fake on
# PATH so the suite runs on the audit-ci-tests box (bats installed, no linter
# binary). The rig below is duplicated in the sibling rather than shared:
# this repo has no bats helper-loading precedent, and a helper file would land
# under .gaia/scripts/tests/ carrying an extension that either escapes
# shell-lint's own *.sh discovery or joins the capability oracle's obligated
# surface. The two copies are held in step by a test below rather than by this
# sentence, since nothing reds when prose is disobeyed.
#
# Assertion style: bash-3.2-safe per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md.

# reads the gate, and so does the count that cross-checks it, so both sides of
# that pairing shrink together when a pass is deleted from the gate and the
# assertion stays green over the loss. This file records the same fact from the

# scripts from the set it runs directly, each with the written reason that THIS
# GATE invokes them. The helper below derives that set rather than restating its

# left to decay. A pass deleted from the gate therefore falsifies that file's
# written reason, and neither side of the pairing above can see it happen.
#

# guard ceasing to run: every excluded guard also carries a sibling suite under

# nothing red. Deriving it means a guard folded in tomorrow is covered the day
# it lands.
