# Tests for `.gaia/scripts/resolve-audit-spawn.sh` (the Code Audit Team SPAWN
# oracle: diff -> members to proactively spawn before `gh pr merge`).
#
# Each test runs the script in an isolated `git init`'d temp dir whose HEAD
# sits on a FEATURE branch off `main`, so the merge-base diff carries the
# branch's own committed files (mirrors resolve-audit-members.bats and
# pr-merge-audit-check.bats). Unlike resolve-audit-members.bats, this script
# shells out to resolve-audit-members.sh at
# "$repo_root/.gaia/scripts/resolve-audit-members.sh", so the sandbox needs
# BOTH scripts copied in (mirrors how pr-merge-audit-check.bats:59-61 copies
# the resolver into its temp repo).
#
# The roster file (.gaia/audit-ci.yml) is written UNTRACKED so it never
# enters the diff under test.
#
# Every Code Audit Team marker is keyed to a member's own content digest, not
# the whole tree. There is no carry-forward clearance machinery: the spawn
# oracle's filter is a plain digest-marker-presence check (a member is
# skipped iff its own valid current-digest earned marker already exists).
#
# Assertion style: bash-3.2-safe per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md.
