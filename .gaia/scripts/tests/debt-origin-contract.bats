# The tech-debt provenance contract's deterministic guard.
#
# What this suite proves: exactly one file states the provenance contract
# (`.claude/skills/file-tech-debt/SKILL.md`, the implementation in
# `.gaia/scripts/debt-origin-lib.sh` exempt as its execution rather than a
# second statement of it); each of the five emitting routes carries an
# instruction pointing at that owner file; the dedup key's deterministic
# consumers still match against an issue body carrying both the dedup-key and
# the provenance comment lines; the documented brake query selects the
# intended set; and the drain's claim and park labels leave the displayed
# count.
#
# What this suite does NOT prove: nothing here verifies that a route actually
# EMITTED the provenance line at run time. Gating on provenance is forbidden
# by the contract itself, so if that gap is ever closed it has to be a
# periodic check rather than a merge gate. Every prose-pointing assertion
# below proves an instruction exists in the shipped surface; none of them
# proves any agent followed it on a given run.
#
# Run under bash 5 (bash 3.2's `[[ ]]` skip-under-set-e gap is real; see
# .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md):
#   source .gaia/scripts/bats5.sh && bats5 .gaia/scripts/tests/debt-origin-contract.bats
#
# Assertion style: bash-3.2-safe per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md.
# Every expected value is a literal rather than a value this suite
# recomputes from the same source it is checking.

  # cache an agent is told to overwrite completely with a free-prose session
  # summary. Both are overwritten wholesale as a pair at release. Neither is
  # an emitting route nor an instruction surface, and neither can be made to
  # point at an owner file, since the next write discards whatever pointer a
  # previous one carried. Without the exclusion, prose quoting a needle
  # verbatim -- which is what a session or a sync about the provenance marker
  # produces -- reds this suite over a generated file's own wording, with a
  # failure message describing the guard's model rather than the tree. The
