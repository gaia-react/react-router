# Tests for .gaia/scripts/lint-sigpipe-readers.sh: the static gate that flags a
# short-circuiting reader standing downstream of a pipe in a file that arms
# `pipefail`, the shape whose pipeline status INVERTS on a match because the
# short-circuiting reader closes the pipe and the upstream dies of SIGPIPE.
#
# THIS SUITE IS THE BLOCKING RUNNER. shell-lint.sh invokes the gate a second,
# advisory way, but a gate run against a tree that is already clean reports
# clean whether its predicate works or not, so a broken predicate is
# indistinguishable from an honest tree there. Every test below drives the gate
# against a fixture tree shaped one way at a time.
#
# Three jobs. Prove the detector fires on the class, in each spelling the gate's
# own header enumerates and across the line breaks a real pipeline uses; prove it stays
# quiet on the legitimate shapes, which for this gate includes the repair it
# advertises, since a gate that reds on its own advice cannot ship; and assert
# the real scanned tree is clean so a regression fails CI.
#
# Two tests are load-bearing beyond coverage. "reds against the historical
# wiki-session-stop shape" carries the exact line gaia-react/gaia#1810 was filed
# against, so the gate is proven to reach the instance it was written for rather
# than a tidied stand-in. And "quiet on the here-string repair" carries the
# shape the gate prints as its fix.
#
# Assertion style: bash-3.2-safe per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md.
#
# The gate resolves its scan surface with `git ls-files` relative to cwd, so
# every fixture is a real git repository with its files added.
