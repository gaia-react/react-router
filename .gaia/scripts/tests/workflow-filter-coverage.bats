# Regression guard for the paths-filter self-coverage invariant.
#
# A step gated on `if: steps.<id>.outputs.<name> == 'true'` runs only when one of
# that filter's globs matched the pull request's changed files. If the step reads
# a file the filter does not list, a pull request that changes only that file
# resolves the output `false`, the step skips, and the job reports GREEN HAVING
# RUN NOTHING. On a declared-required context that green is what branch
# protection reads, so the change merges having been checked by nothing.
#
# The failure is invisible by construction: the check is green, and green is also
# the correct result for a pull request that genuinely touches nothing relevant,
# so the two cases are indistinguishable from the outside. Nothing but this suite
# compares the two sets.
#
# The class recurs. Every instance so far was found by hand after the fact: a
# filter that omitted the suite guarding its own gate, two entries made no-ops by
# a catch-all above them, a comment naming a narrower surface than the suite had,
# a gate extracted into a script that left its workflow's filter behind, and the
# two the `.husky/**` and `.github/workflows/**` globs in shell-lint.yml were each
# added to close. Those two globs carry the repo's own written record that this
# recurs.
#
# What this guard asserts, and what it deliberately does not
#
# A gated step's real inputs are not statically knowable: a `run:` block is
# arbitrary shell and may read anything. So this is a FLOOR, not a complete
# accounting. It asserts the narrow invariant most recorded instances violated:
#
#   every repo-relative path a gated step names LITERALLY must be reachable by
#   the globs of the filter output that gates it,
#
# where "names literally" means a git-tracked file appearing as a whitespace-
# delimited token in the step's `run:` body, after any `$VAR` whose value is a
# literal string in an `env:` block in scope has been substituted for that value,
# plus the `action.yml` of a local composite action the step `uses:`. Each gated
# step's own workflow file counts as an input of itself, which is the
# self-coverage half: a gate must re-run on a change to its own definition.
#
# The following are deliberately out of scope, because each needs a mechanism
# this floor does not have and a decision this suite should not make on its own
# (unnumbered as a set, so adding one cannot rot a count in this sentence):
#
#   1. Transitive inputs. A step invoking `run-all.sh` gets that script checked,
#      not the files the scenarios inside it inspect. Reaching those needs either
#      a declared-inputs convention on every gated step or a runtime witness.
#   2. Paths built at runtime. A `$NAME` or `${NAME}` reference is resolved
#      wherever it sits in the body, not only as a leading segment, whenever an
#      `env:` block in scope states the value outright as a literal string; that
#      much is right there in the file. Every other shape stays invisible to a
#      token scan and always will be, and the rule generating that set is that
#      one pass over the file does not answer it: a `${{ }}` value, a name
#      assigned in the shell, a glob expansion, a value holding another `$NAME`
#      (the substitution runs once and does not recurse).
#   3. Composite-action bodies. A local action's own `run:` steps are not
#      descended into; only its `action.yml` is checked.
#   4. A filter propagated across jobs. The gate scan reads
#      `steps.<id>.outputs.<name>`, so a paths-filter run in a setup job and
#      exposed through that job's `outputs:` for a downstream job to gate on as
#      `needs.<job>.outputs.<name>` is invisible here -- to the coverage
#      assertions AND to the section-4 escape-hatch pin, with no exemption
#      entry required. Nothing in the tree uses that shape today. Recorded
#      rather than left implied absent, because section 4 exists precisely so
#      that coverage cannot be dropped silently, and this is a second exit.
#
# Under-reaching is the deliberate bias: a path this suite cannot see is a path it
# says nothing about, never a path it silently blesses. The extraction-intact
# tests in section 1 are what keep "says nothing about" from quietly becoming
# "says nothing at all".
#
# Hand-rolled gates (a `run:` block emitting `code=true` from its own diff scan,
# as tests.yml does) are a different shape with no glob list to read, so they are
# out of the coverage assertion. Section 4 pins the exempt set so a new workflow
# cannot evade this guard by hand-rolling its filter.
#
# Assertion style: bash-3.2-safe per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md.
#
# The negative tests below point the extractor at synthetic fixtures written into
# $BATS_TEST_TMPDIR. bats runs each `@test` body in its own subshell and re-runs
# `setup()` before each one, so nothing written there leaks between tests. The
# checker sees only the subshell and reports the cross-test leak it implies, hence
# the file-wide suppression on the next line. Keep that line last in this block: a
# following comment opening with the checker's own name parses as a second,
# malformed directive (SC1073) and fails the lint outright.

# The workflows this guard reads are a precondition on CI, not a maybe: the job
# that runs this suite checks the repo out whole, so an absent path there means
# the directory was renamed and this guard silently stopped guarding. So the CI
