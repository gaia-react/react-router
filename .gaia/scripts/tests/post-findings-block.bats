# carrying it (the local counterpart to the block CI's own workflow prompt

# The read spans the whole fix loop, not one round: the base half of the key
# advances one stamp per cleared audit round, so selecting on it posts only the
# final round, which is clean by construction (gaia-react/gaia#1573). The suite
# covers both directions of the widened glob -- every base for this branch is
# read, and no other branch's is.
#
# Every test runs against an isolated sandbox with a stub `gh` on PATH, never
# a real network call.

# stub_gh <comments-json>: a fake `gh` supporting `auth status` (ok), `pr view`

# a call WITH --method records its method and the body value it was handed for
# assertions, and always "succeeds" (prints a fake comment id). Every
# invocation is appended to GH_LOG.
#
# The body value follows real `gh api` field semantics (`gh api --help`):
# `-F/--field` expands a leading `@` to the named file's CONTENTS, while
# `-f/--raw-field` sends the value as the literal STRING it is. Modelling both
# flags the same way would green a caller that posts a temp path instead of the
