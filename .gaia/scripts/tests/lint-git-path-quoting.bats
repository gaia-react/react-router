# Tests for .gaia/scripts/lint-git-path-quoting.sh: the static gate that flags
# an executed `git diff --name-only` or `git ls-files` which omits `-z`, so
# git's default `core.quotePath` cannot C-quote a path the caller then parses.
#
# Two jobs, the same pair the sibling array-guard suite carries: prove the
# detector fires on a known-bad fixture in each scanned file type (shell, husky
# hook, workflow YAML, a fenced block in markdown) and stays quiet on every
# legitimate shape (a `-z` call, a comment, a markdown code span, unfenced
# markdown prose, a string constant, an untracked file), and assert the real
# scanned tree is clean so a regression fails CI.
#
# Two groups of tests are load-bearing beyond coverage, and both exist because a
# guard that has never been shown to red against a real historical instance has
# asserted nothing about the class it was written for.
#
#   `#1229` makes that binding for the `diff --name-only` half: "reds against
#   the pre-fix worthiness-presence-check.sh derivation" is that test.
#
#   `#1389` makes it binding for the `ls-files` half, and names five discovery
#   call sites the extended guard must red against in their PRE-FIX form. The
#   five `@test`s under "the five pre-fix ls-files discovery sites" are that
#   requirement, one per site. Their point is the fixture BODY, which is the
#   literal pre-fix line copied from each site; the paths are the real ones so a
#   reader can trace a failing test back to what it was written for.
#
#   `#1392` makes it binding for the `diff` half's option spellings: a fixed
#   substring match could not see `--cached` or `--staged`, so the group under
#   "3a. The diff option region" pairs two pre-fix site fixtures with the
#   negative controls that keep the widened match from claiming a diff call
#   which prints no paths at all.
#
#   `#1400` makes it binding for the markdown half, and names three executed
#   documentation snippets the widened guard must red against in their PRE-FIX
#   form. The three `@test`s under "3c. The markdown half" are that requirement,
#   one per site, paired with the controls that keep the fence rule from
#   claiming the illustrative mentions that surround them.
#
# Assertion style: bash-3.2-safe per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md.
#
# The linter resolves its scan surface with `git ls-files` relative to cwd, so
# every fixture is a real git repository with its files added. That is also
# what pins the untracked-file test below: an untracked script is not scanned.
