# Tests for `.gaia/scripts/audit-scratch-dir.sh` -- the per-member mutation
# scratch directory a Code Audit Team member gets instead of improvising a
# name inside the session scratchpad its co-dispatched siblings share.
#
# The property under test throughout is WAVE SAFETY: two members resolving the
# same audit key must never resolve the same directory. That is the whole
# reason the name carries the member half, so the suite asserts it directly
# rather than only asserting the path's shape.
#
# Every test drives the scratch root through $GAIA_AUDIT_SCRATCH_ROOT, so no
# test resolves a real main checkout or writes anywhere under the repo's own
# .gaia/local.
#
# WHICH TREE A CASE RUNS IN is stated here rather than left to be inferred,
# because the subject reads it from the `<dir>` positional, which defaults to
# the process working directory, and this file has cases on both sides of
# that. setup() pins a PLAIN checkout, so a case that says nothing about trees
# gets one, and that is a fixture rather than an accident of where bats was
# launched. A case needing a different answer cds there itself, or names the
# tree it wants as `<dir>`, and the pin decides nothing for it; the
# `mint/populate asymmetry` block at the foot is where those live, and it
# carries both answers rather than one.
#
# Assertion style: bash-3.2-safe per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md.
#
# Run under bash 5 (bash 3.2's `[[ ]]` skip-under-set-e gap is real):

  # both from the process working directory, and left ambient that is whatever

# --- the mint/populate asymmetry (gaia-react/gaia#1759) -----------------------
#
# A member dispatched into a linked worktree is handed a directory it cannot
# reach with Write/Edit. The two halves fail differently, which is what makes
# it confusing rather than obvious: the mint SUCCEEDS (mkdir -p from Bash) and
# the populate FAILS (the runtime's own worktree confinement refuses a
# file_path that leaves the tree, and `.gaia/local` is one symlink to main's).
#
# GAIA cannot make that Write succeed -- the refusal is the runtime's, not any
# guard's -- so what the mint owes its caller is the constraint, said once, at
# the moment the path is handed over. These cases pin that it is said in the
# worktree case, NOT said otherwise, and said on stderr so a caller capturing
# stdout still gets a bare path.

# Builds a real linked worktree off $REPO and echoes its path. Real rather
# than mocked: gaia_is_linked_worktree is layout-derived, so a fake directory
# would assert nothing about the predicate the script actually consults.
# git keeps its own stderr here: when a runner cannot create a worktree, that
# message is the only thing naming why every case below red, and the cases
# themselves can only report the assignment that failed.
