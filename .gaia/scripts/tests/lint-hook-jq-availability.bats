# Conformance suite for .gaia/scripts/lint-hook-jq-availability.sh -- the gate
# that reds when a blocking PreToolUse hook's jq-availability arm stands the
# hook down instead of refusing.
#
# This suite IS the blocking runner. shell-lint.sh invokes the check a second
# way, but a gate run against a tree whose arms are already correct reports
# clean whether its predicates work or not, so an inert predicate is
# indistinguishable from an honest tree there. Every test drives the check
# through its <repo_root> parameter against a fixture tree shaped one way at a
# time, and each predicate gets its own test rather than being trusted.
#
# Run under bash 5: `bash .gaia/scripts/bats5.sh .gaia/scripts/tests/lint-hook-jq-availability.bats`.
#
# Assertion style: bash-3.2-safe per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md.
