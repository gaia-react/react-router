# SC2016 is intentional file-wide, matching the script under test: the fixture
# writers use single-quoted printf format strings where a $ is literal output
# text (the heredoc line they emit into a fixture), not a shell expansion.
# shellcheck disable=SC2016
# SC2317 and SC2329 likewise, and both trace to one cause that is not bats'
# `@test` dispatch: a `@test` body parses as a top-level brace group rather than
# a function, so each bare `return 0` terminating a test below reads as a
# script-level return. Every `@test` after one then reads as unreachable
# (SC2317), and a helper defined past one reads as never invoked because its
# call sites do (SC2329). Every test runs. shell-lint gates `.bats` at
# severity=warning, above both codes, so this only quiets an ad-hoc run. The
# spelling that avoids both outright is the explicit `true`
# .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md prescribes, and
# .gaia/tests/shell-lint.sh's header carries the full account.
# shellcheck disable=SC2317,SC2329
# Tests for .gaia/scripts/verify-audit-roster.sh, the roster's deterministic
# check.
#
# Every invariant is exercised against FIXTURES injected through --config (the
# roster) and --root (everything the check reads about that roster: the agent
# files and both machinery lists). No test mutates the repo's real roster or its
# real machinery lists; UAT-024 is the one test that reads them, and it only
# reads.
#
# Assertion style: bash-3.2-safe per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md.
