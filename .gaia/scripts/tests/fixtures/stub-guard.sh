# stub-guard.sh: a fixture adopting the shared guard library by sourcing alone.
# It detects one trivial class, the literal token STUBCLASS, and carries no
# fixture discrimination and no pragma parsing of its own: every answer about
# whether a line is data, whether a pragma covers it, and whether the file was
# readable to the end comes from guard-awk-lib.sh. Its non-boilerplate body is
# budgeted at forty lines and the sibling suite asserts the count, so an adopter
# needing more machinery than this reds a test instead of quietly re-inventing a
# tokenizer.
#
# It calls gaia_scan_reset, gaia_scan_feed, gaia_scan_skip, gaia_scan_suppressed
# and gaia_scan_end. It deliberately does NOT call gaia_scan_prepass,
# gaia_scan_prepass_end, gaia_scan_pragma_here or gaia_scan_run_only: a
# single-pass adopter needs no prepass, reports on one surface so it has no
# off-surface pragma to name, and detects a class errexit arming does not reach.
# The conformance check is written against exactly that split.
#
# Usage: stub-guard.sh [file ...]. With no argument it takes the tracked bats
# set from the library, which is also what exercises the empty-surface error.
