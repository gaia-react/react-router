#!/usr/bin/env bats
# The shared PATH primitives in .gaia/tests/helpers/path.sh.
#
# A bats suite that drives a "tool is not installed" arm on a developer machine
# where the tool really is installed needs a PATH with that tool guaranteed
# absent. The need arrived independently in suites across the tree, each with
# its own hand-rolled rebuild loop; a tree-wide grep for `helpers/path.sh`
# answers which suites are clients today. Separately, and not at every one of
# those loops, the membership test was written as `[ -x "$dir/$name" ]`.
#
# That predicate is wrong in one direction. `-x` is true for a searchable
# DIRECTORY named for the tool, not only for an executable file, so a PATH
# entry that merely holds such a directory was dropped along with every real
# tool it provides. bash's own PATH lookup accepts a regular file that is
# executable, which is `-f` and `-x` together.
#
# The direction is safe -- an over-strip removes a needed tool and fails the
# command under test rather than greening it -- so what makes this worth a
# primitive is the DUPLICATION rather than the defect. A rule with two homes
# gets repaired in one of them, and the copy nobody edited has nothing red to
# catch the drift. This file holds the single home to the standard the copies
# could not be held to: it drives the over-strip case directly, with a control
# proving the old predicate really does accept it.
#
# The same DUPLICATION argument, and not the predicate defect, is what brings
# the additive shape here too: building an allowlist directory shares no code
# with subtracting a providing directory, but it arrived as its own set of
# hand-rolled copies in the same way and drifts in the same way. Its cases sit
# at the end of this file, and what they pin is a different property, since
# there is no providing directory for them to reason about.
#
# Assertion style: bash-3.2-safe per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md.
