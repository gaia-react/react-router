# Tests for .gaia/scripts/lint-oracle-blind-invocations.sh: the gate that flags
# an invocation the capability oracle's anchors cannot see, by differencing
# bash's own reading of command position against the anchors' reading of the
# same line.
#
# The jobs. Prove the detector fires on a shape the anchors miss. Prove it
# stays quiet on the paired shape the anchors accept, and on the prose that
# looks identical once quoting is invisible -- the false-positive direction the
# whole design exists to avoid. Prove the command-prefix list the script
# carries is driven per entry rather than sampled. And assert the real scanned
# tree is clean, so a regression fails CI.
#
# The mutation control is the arm worth reading. Every positive here would also
# pass if the alias machinery silently stopped expanding and the check reported
# every candidate word, so one arm strips the `shopt -s expand_aliases` line out
# of a copy of the script and requires the fixture to come back clean. Without
# it the suite cannot tell "bash says this is a command" from "the check says
# so about everything".
#
# Assertion style: bash-3.2-safe per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md.
# The lint is invoked as `bash "$LINTER"` from a fixture cwd, matching how CI
# runs it from the repo root; its scan roots are cwd-relative.
