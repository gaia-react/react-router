# shell an agent runs through its shell tool, zsh on a stock Mac, not the bash
# a settings-registered hook gets, and for most of that milestone the refusal
# was dead under zsh while a bash-only meter read green. This section is what
# keeps the hardening honest as the call-site count grows. It tests the block
# AS WRITTEN in each file, under the shell the call site really uses, from a
# REAL linked worktree, not a copy hand-transcribed into this suite.
#
# Classification of which flows carry the refusal and which do not lives in
# .gaia/local/plans/worktree-program-next/RUNBOOK.md, which is machine-local
# and gitignored; this test cannot read it, so the two lists below are
# hardcoded here instead, with this comment naming where the classification
# itself lives.

# The classified flows that carry the refusal, and each one's flow-name
# literal at the same array index. Order matches the RUNBOOK.md
# classification's own ordering, not alphabetical.

# The flows that must never carry the refusal: each provisions or drives
# its own worktree mid-flow (gaia-plan, gaia-debt's fix path) or must stay
# reachable from inside one (gaia-spec, gaia-forensics, gaia-handoff,
# gaia-pickup, file-tech-debt). This half is what catches a future drive-by
# adding the refusal to one of these, e.g. onto /gaia-plan, which would break
# plan execution the moment the flow enters the worktree it just created.
#
# distribution-audit joins them on a different warrant, and one worth stating
# because the refusal did sit on it. What decides it is what the flow writes:
# /distribution-audit writes `.gaia/manifest.json` and `.gaia/release-exclude`,
# git-tracked branch-scoped files a linked worktree isolates correctly, and it
# writes nothing under `.gaia/local`, so a worktree run collides with no shared
# state. Meanwhile the `gh pr create` distribution pre-flight demands that
# answer land on the worktree's own branch, which the main checkout cannot
# supply, so a refusal here made the hook's own remediation unfollowable. The
# release path's main-only property is enforced at /gaia-release's own call
# site above, not here.
#
# That warrant stands on its own and deliberately does not rest on
# main-only-lib.sh's docblock, which disclaims deciding membership and points
# here instead. Reading the motivating case the docblock does record reaches
# the same verdict anyway: that sentence is a conjunction, a
# VERSION/lockfile/cache-state write AND opening or driving a PR, and
# /distribution-audit satisfies neither half. CALL_SITE_FILES is the roster,
# and the `call-site roster:` census tests are what enforce it.
