# Tests for .gaia/scripts/audit-write-clearance.sh, the ONE shared writer for
# every Code Audit Team clearance artifact, and its acceptance by the shared
# reader .claude/hooks/lib/audit-clearance.sh.
#
# The writer takes the audited working root as a REQUIRED argument, derives
# the member's content digest from it via the digest engine
# (.claude/hooks/lib/audit-digest.sh, never from CWD), writes atomically, and
# records a versioned schema-4 body with a `provenance` field. It is NOT
# evidence-gated: it takes no --report, calls no detector, and its body
# carries no evidence block. Provenance is earned or refused only; there is no
# carried family, no --anchor-tree, and every write lands unconditionally
# (overwrites a stale body at the same path).
#
# Assertion style: bash-3.2-safe per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md.
