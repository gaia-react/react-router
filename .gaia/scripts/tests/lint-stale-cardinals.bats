# Tests for .gaia/scripts/lint-stale-cardinals.sh: the static gate that flags a
# definite cardinal naming a countable set of repository artifacts in a comment
# or a bats `@test` name, where nothing recounts the set.
#
# Three jobs. Prove the detector fires on the class; prove it stays quiet on
# every legitimate shape, which for this gate is the load-bearing half, because
# the predicate is a prose predicate and a gate nobody can keep green gets
# switched off; and assert the real scanned tree is clean so a regression fails
# CI.
#
# Two tests are load-bearing beyond coverage, and both carry a historical form
# verbatim rather than a tidied stand-in. A gate written for a class must red
# against that class's real shape or it asserts nothing about the class it was
# written for. `reds against the naming-convention header form` and `reds
# against the derived-count separator form` are the two instances that motivated
# this gate, copied from the comments they were found in: one spells its
# cardinal as a word and sits directly against its noun, the other spells it as
# digits and sits behind a modifier. They fail differently, and a detector that
# reaches one does not necessarily reach the other -- the digit form was in fact
# missed by the first draft of the noun vocabulary, which is why it is pinned
# here rather than trusted.
#
# Assertion style: bash-3.2-safe per .claude/rules/bats-assertions.md.
#
# The gate resolves its scan surface with `git ls-files` relative to cwd, so
# every fixture is a real git repository with its files added. It sources
# guard-awk-lib.sh from beside its own path, which is the real .gaia/scripts/
# rather than the fixture, so no fixture seeds a copy of the library.

#
# That is not a style choice. The shared library classifies a bats line as
# fixture DATA partly by the command word that writes it, against a closed set
# of writer names it recognizes (guard-awk-lib.sh, `G_classify`). `fixture_file`
# and `fixture_script` are in that set; a locally-invented wrapper is not, so
# every line of a multi-line body handed to one is read as executed shell and
# this suite's own fixture prose is reported as a live finding. Adding a name to
# the shared set to suit one suite widens a contract every consumer of that
# library depends on, so the call goes direct instead.

# at_test <name>: one literal bats test declaration, ASSEMBLED rather than
# written out.
#
# Bats preprocesses this file before bash ever sees it, and it rewrites any
# SOURCE line whose first token is `@test` into a bats_test_function call. It
# does that inside a single-quoted string exactly as it does at the top level,
# and it strips leading whitespace first, so indenting does not save the line
# either. A fixture needing a real `@test` on disk therefore cannot spell one at
# the start of a line in this file.
#
# The failure is silent and it looks like a gate bug: the fixture is written,
# tracked and scanned as usual, and the gate answers correctly about the
