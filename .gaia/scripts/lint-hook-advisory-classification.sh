# lint-hook-advisory-classification.sh: flag a hook that BLOCKS but is filed
# under an Advisory heading on a wiki page. Exit 0 when no advisory section
# names a blocking hook, 1 with a per-entry report on any hit, 2 on the check's
# own failure, and 130 or 143 when a SIGINT or SIGTERM interrupts it. Run it
# from anywhere:
# `bash .gaia/scripts/lint-hook-advisory-classification.sh [<repo_root>]`.
# gaia:maintainer-only:start
#
# Enforced by the sibling bats suite
# .gaia/scripts/tests/lint-hook-advisory-classification.bats, which the
# `Audit CI Tests` scripts shard runs, and folded into .gaia/tests/shell-lint.sh,
# whose `**/*.md`, `**/*.sh` and `.claude/settings.json` paths-filter entries
# between them arm it on all three surfaces it reads.
# gaia:maintainer-only:end
#
# Why: .gaia/scripts/lint-hook-wiki-inventory.sh asks whether every registered
# hook is MENTIONED on the inventory page, and says in its own header that it
# deliberately asks only that. Presence is not the only thing a hook page
# claims. It also CLASSIFIES: a reader deciding whether an action will be
# stopped reads the heading a hook sits under and stops there. A blocking hook
# filed as advisory is a silent wrong answer of the worse kind, because the page
# reads as authoritative and the reader has no cue to check. It stood on two
# pages at once (`pr-merge-audit-check.sh`, which denies `gh pr merge` until
# every dispatched audit member has cleared, filed as "reminds to run the
# audit"), and neither the inventory guard nor any review round saw it: the hook
# was mentioned, so presence was satisfied, and the classification is prose
# nothing compared against the script.
#
# ONE DIRECTION, deliberately, and the opposite one from the inventory guard's.
# This asks only whether a hook filed as ADVISORY blocks. It does not ask
# whether every hook filed as blocking still blocks. The reverse needs a parse
# of what a blocking section CLAIMS about each entry rather than a membership
# test, and those sections legitimately name hooks they are not classifying --
# a sibling PostToolUse recorder named inside a blocking entry's prose is the
# live example -- so a naive reverse sweep would report each of those as a
# misfiled entry. That direction is real drift and is worth its own check
# written against a parse that can tell an entry from a mention.
#
# ENTRY SHAPE, not mention, which is the inversion of the inventory guard's
# choice and is right for the opposite reason. The inventory guard wants
# mention, because a hook named anywhere on the page is reachable by a reader
# searching it, and mention therefore has no false-positive class for a
# PRESENCE question. Classification is not conferred by a mention: a sentence
# reading "unlike block-rm-rf.sh, this one only nudges" names a blocking hook
# inside an advisory section and is entirely correct prose. What confers the
# classification is the list ENTRY, so only the name inside the item's LEADING
# CODE SPAN is graded, which is the shape every entry on these pages uses:
# an optional bold wrapper around a backtick-delimited filename, at the head of
# the item.
#
# The leading span, not "the text before the first colon", and the difference is
# a whole false-positive class rather than a refinement. Keying on the colon
# leaves a bullet that carries none, or one whose colon falls after the name,
# scanning the entire line, so ordinary cross-referencing prose in an advisory
# section reds the check and is handed a repair instruction telling the author
# to move an entry that is not an entry. The span test has no such fallback: a
# bullet with no leading code span is graded not at all.
#
# THE ORACLE. Which registrations this gate reads, what makes a hook count as
# blocking, and which direction that reading errs in, all live in
# .gaia/scripts/hook-registration-lib.sh, which this gate shares with the jq
# availability gate. Both questions are the same for both gates, so neither
# carries its own copy of the answer. What this gate adds on top of it is the
# entry parse above and the verdict below.
#
# Fail-closed by construction, at each stage guards-must-fail.md names:
#   discovery -- settings.json missing, unparseable, registering no PreToolUse
#                hook, or yielding no blocking hook at all, exits 2
#   arming    -- no tracked wiki markdown at all exits 2, never 0
#   match     -- the entry test is a fixed-string search for the basename inside
#                a list item, so it admits no regex metacharacter in a filename
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible. Never `cd`.
