# .gaia/scripts/tests/lint-errexit-source-guard.bats runs in the `Audit CI Tests`
# scripts shard, a declared-required context; it fails when this scan finds a
# hit and self-tests the detector against known-bad fixtures. That job's `code`
# filter is what arms it, so EVERY root the scan below walks has to be named
# there, by a glob broad enough to cover the whole root; a path the scan reads
# and the filter misses reports green having run this assertion zero times,
# which is the failure this gate exists to prevent, one level up. Adding a root
# to the scan below is therefore always two edits, here and in that filter.
# `Shell Lint` runs the same scan a second way through .gaia/tests/shell-lint.sh;
# it is advisory rather than required, so it reports a regression without

# Why: under errexit, sourcing a file that is present but UNPARSEABLE abandons
# the shell at the load, on bash 3.2.57 and 5.3 alike. In a PreToolUse hook that
# exit is 2, the deny code, so an interrupted `/update-gaia`, an unresolved merge
# conflict, or a truncated write turns a hook into a gate that denies every tool
# call -- including the edit that would repair the library. The class has been
# repaired one site at a time, round after round, because the repair reached for
# was `bash -n X && . X`, a proof about exactly one file: `bash -n` does not
# RECURSE, so each round's fix left a residual one source level deeper, and each
# round found it there. This check works on the errexit-reachable source CLOSURE,
# so it sees a library's own loads whether or not any consumer parse-checked the
# library, and no future round can leave a residual it cannot see INSIDE the
# scan roots below. The closure stops at those roots, so a load in a file they
# do not cover is outside this check whatever sources it; the qualifier is the
# honest form of the claim, and widening the roots is what changes it.
#
# Reference fixes: .claude/hooks/block-no-verify.sh (flat bracket, a file that
# arms errexit itself) and .claude/hooks/lib/verb-arming.sh (state-preserving
# bracket, a library that inherits it).
#
# The two accepted shapes, and why there are two rather than one:
#
#   # in a file that arms errexit ITSELF -- a flat restore is what it had
#   set +e; [ -f X ] && . X 2>/dev/null; set -e
#   type some_fn >/dev/null 2>&1 || <degrade>
#
#   # in a LIBRARY, which inherits errexit from whichever caller sourced it
#   errexit_was=0; case $- in *e*) errexit_was=1 ;; esac
#   set +e
#   . X 2>/dev/null
#   if [ "$errexit_was" = 1 ]; then set -e; fi
#   type some_fn >/dev/null 2>&1 || <degrade>
#
# A library's callers do not all arm errexit -- verb-arming.sh has eleven and
# seven do not -- so a flat `set -e` ARMS errexit in those seven, and the caller
# then dies at its next non-zero command. That is why the flat shape is a hit at
# a library site rather than a style preference, and why this check answers a
# second question per site: is this file an ENTRY POINT, or is it sourced?
#
# The entry-point test is "arms errexit itself AND nothing in the scan set
# sources it", not "arms errexit itself". A file can be both: a script run as
# `bash <path>` that a second file also sources. Its own `set -e` says nothing
# about the shell it lands in when it is sourced, so the weaker test would
# certify a flat restore in exactly the file that has both callers to get wrong.
#
# `"${BASH:-bash}" -n X && . X` is also accepted. It is measurably safe (it
# degrades on missing and on unparseable, both interpreters) and a good many
# sites carry it; it costs a fork per load, which is why it is not the shape to
# reach for in new code, but it is not a defect.
#
# What this check does NOT cover, decided rather than inherited: whether the
# DEGRADE path is itself safe. A guarded load that fails still leaves every
# variable the successful load would have assigned unset, and under `set -u` the
# first read of one aborts the shell just as the source would have -- which is
# how block-rm-rf.sh failed while this class was being repaired. That is a
# different predicate (unset-variable reachability, not guard shape), it needs
# the whole function body rather than the load site, and folding it in here
# would make one check answer two questions and report both under one name. It
# is left to `type <fn> >/dev/null 2>&1 || <degrade>` at the site, which every
# reference fix above already carries, and to review.

# Scan surface: the hook bodies and their libraries, plus every script under
# each scan root (recursive). `find` (not a `**` glob) keeps the recursive walk
# portable to bash 3.2, which has no globstar. Paths stay cwd-relative so the
# printed file:line is repo-relative when the linter runs from the repo root.
#
# The roots are a variable rather than literal `find` arguments because the set
# differs between this repo and an adopter's. A root that ships must stay on the
# base assignment; one that does not must be appended inside a maintainer-only
# block, or the release runtime-dependency check reads it as a shipped script
# reaching for a path the bundle does not carry, and fails the staging build.
#
# Every `tests/` directory under a root is excluded below: their bats fixtures
# deliberately plant broken loads, and a check that reads its own negative
# fixtures as findings can never be clean. The prune is one `! -path '*/tests/*'`
# rather than a per-root list, so it covers `.gaia/scripts/tests` and
# `.github/audit/tests` alike and needs no edit when a root is added.
#
# `.github` is a root because its `audit/` scripts run under `set -e` on CI and
# load `gaia-version.sh` the same way the hooks do; leaving it out is what let
# two instances of this class sit unreached while the repair for a third landed
# next to them (gaia-react/gaia#1870). It is also what makes that repair
# defensible: the bats matrix is ubuntu-only, so a revert to the `|| true` shape
# reds only on a local macOS run, and nothing but this scan would catch it.

  # Is `pre` -- the raw text from the start of the line through the `-n` this
  # walk just matched -- a BASH INVOCATION carrying that flag? Three steps: cut
  # back to the command segment, strip the compound-command keywords that may
  # precede a command word, and require the command WORD itself to name bash.
  #
  # Command position is the whole point, and a substring test is what it
  # replaces. `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` and `${BASH_VERSINFO[0]}` are this tree`s
  # commonest library-header idioms, and both name the string this test used to
  # look for, so `[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" != "" -a -n "$x" ] && . X` read as a
  # parse-checked load of X. The header above states the stronger contract this
  # implements: the `-n` is a flag to a bash invocation, in that order and with
  # no command separator between them.
  #
  # Three spellings are accepted, all of them live here: a bare `bash`, a path
  # ending in `/bash`, and a parameter expansion of `BASH` -- the reference
  # shape writes `"${BASH:-bash}" -n X`, with the name inside quotes, which is
  # why the quotes are stripped rather than required absent, and why a `:-`
  # default is read and required to name bash too.
  #
  # The strip has to name EVERY reserved word that can precede a command word,
  # or the command this reads is the keyword and a real check goes uncredited.
  # A first draft named `if`/`elif`/`then`/`do` and stopped, which refused four
  # one-line spellings the check credited before it: an `else` arm, a `while` or
  # `until` header, and a `case` arm. None can be a command name, so stripping
  # them opens no hole this arm did not already have -- the same-line credit has
  # never tested the ORDER of the check and the load, so `. X; bash -n X` is
  # credited too. Ordering is what the multi-line arm`s `then` containment test
  # buys, and widening this list neither adds to nor subtracts from it.
  #
  # Refused, fail-closed and deliberately, each of them absent from this tree:
  # `! bash -n X`, whose negation inverts the answer, so crediting the branch
  # below it would be backwards; an invocation behind an environment assignment
  # or behind `env`/`command`; and any non-option word between the command word
  # and the flag, which is what keeps `bash X -n` from certifying a load of X.
  # Every one of those reports a load whose author can re-spell it into a
  # credited shape. The opposite direction certifies a load nothing checked,
  # which is the abort this whole check exists to end.
