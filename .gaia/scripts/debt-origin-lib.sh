#
# GAIA shared tech-debt provenance helper (single-sourced).
#
# Prints ONE HTML-comment line recording the branch a tech-debt finding was
# surfaced from and the session that filed it. It sits beside the existing
# `gaia-debt-key` line on a filed issue, or on a waived finding's
# pull-request-body entry:
#
#   <!-- gaia-debt-origin: branch=<b> mode=<m> unit=<u> changed=<c> head=<h> session=<s> -->
#
# Six key=value pairs, single spaces, that order, one line, newline
# terminated. There is no version prefix, and no reader may depend on the
# field order: the order is canonical for human readability only.
#
# A filed issue records what the defect is and nothing about where it was
# surfaced. This line is what lets a triager reading the backlog months later
# tell which branch the finding was surfaced from and, where the route
# resolved one, whether the cited file was in the reviewed change's own
# changed-file set. `mode` and `unit` are derived from the branch name, so
# neither records who filed; the contract in
# .claude/skills/file-tech-debt/SKILL.md states the limitation that puts on
# a reader.
#
# `session` is the one field here that answers WHO, and it is the only one
# read off the process rather than the checkout. Branch-derived provenance is
# right for the common case, one session on its own branch, and wrong whenever
# two share a checkout: the filer inherits the other's `mode` and `unit`, and
# an inherited `unit` naming another live drain is worse than an absent one,
# because nothing downstream can tell the two apart. A session id is immune to
# that by construction, since no branch move reaches it.
#
# FAIL-OPEN, deliberately inverting the fail-closed rule of the sibling
# .gaia/scripts/audit-key-lib.sh. Where gaia_audit_key refuses to print a
# half-built key, this helper prints the literal `unknown` in any slot it
# cannot resolve and exits 0 regardless. A caller never treats the output as a
# precondition. A line of unknowns says "the route ran and resolved nothing";
# an ABSENT line says "the route predates provenance". Those two facts stay
# distinguishable, so a route that gets no line omits it and continues, and
# nothing is ever blocked, retried, or deferred because provenance is partial.
#
# gaia_debt_origin_encode <text>
#   Prints <text> with `%` replaced by `%25` FIRST, then `>` replaced by
#   `%3E`. No other byte changes. Always returns 0. Exactly two characters are
#   reserved: `>` because a git branch name may legally contain one and an
#   unencoded one would terminate the HTML comment early and leak the
#   remainder as visible text, and `%` itself so the encoding is invertible
#   and a reader recovers the exact branch name. Encoding `%` before `>` is
#   what makes the inverse (`%3E` back to `>`, then `%25` back to `%`) exact.
#
# gaia_debt_origin_classify <normalized-branch>
#   Prints "<mode> <unit>", one space between them. Always returns 0. The
#   argument is a branch already put through this file's normalization; the
#   ladder in gaia_debt_origin_line owns the "no branch resolved" case, so
#   this function is never handed one.
#
# gaia_debt_origin_line [--changed <v>] [--branch <name>] [--dir <path>]
#   Prints exactly one newline-terminated line. Returns 0 unconditionally,
#   including outside a git repository and on an unrecognized argument.
#   Reads CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID from the environment for `session`, which is
#   deliberately not a flag: the field's whole value is that it names the
#   process actually filing, and an override would let a caller restamp
#   authorship the way `--branch` legitimately restamps the branch.
#
# Deliberately NOT reusing gaia_key_slug from audit-key-lib.sh: that function
# encodes every byte outside [A-Za-z0-9_-], which would render
# `debt/1121-marker-sep` as `debt%2F1121-marker-sep`. This value is read by
# humans, so its reserved set is two characters and its encoder is its own.
#
# This file resolves no repository root and computes no diff base. `changed`
# is supplied by the caller, which is the only place that knows which
# fork-point set the answer belongs to. No side effects at source time; it
# defines functions only and succeeds under `set -u` in a directory that is
# not a git repository.
#
# Usage (sourced):
#   . .gaia/scripts/debt-origin-lib.sh
#   origin="$(gaia_debt_origin_line --changed 1)"

# Usage (executable):
#   bash .gaia/scripts/debt-origin-lib.sh [--changed <v>] [--branch <name>] [--dir <path>]

# gaia_debt_origin_encode <text>
# `LC_ALL=C` scopes the replacement to bytes (bash re-evaluates the locale on
# assignment, even to an unexported local), so a multi-byte branch name cannot
# make the substitution locale-dependent. The two replacements are written as
# two ordered parameter expansions rather than one character walk because the
# ORDER is the contract: `%` first, so the `%` this function itself introduces
# in `%3E` is never re-encoded, and `>` second.
#
# Both patterns are backslash-escaped, and the `%` one has to be: zsh reads
# `${var//%pat/repl}` as an END-ANCHORED replacement, so an unescaped `%` there
# is an anchor over an empty pattern and appends `%25` instead of encoding
# anything. `\%` is a literal `%` in bash and zsh alike. `\>` is escaped for
# the same defensive reason (zsh's `<x-y>` numeric glob gives `>` a meaning
# bash does not) and is identical in both shells. The escapes cost nothing and
# remove the only shell-specific construct in this function, matching
# audit-key-lib.sh's reason for spelling its own walk `${text:$i:1}`.
