# lint-collapsed-signal-trap.sh: flag every `trap` that binds EXIT together with
# INT or TERM in one arm, across the framework's tracked shell, the extensionless
# husky hooks, its CI workflow and composite-action YAML, the adopter workflow
# templates, and its tracked bats suites. Run it directly from the repo root:
# `bash .gaia/scripts/lint-collapsed-signal-trap.sh`.
#
# Exit 0 when clean, and 1 either with a file:line report on any hit or on a
# scan surface that came back empty. Two statuses say the gate never ran at
# all: 2 when guard-awk-lib.sh is missing beside this script, and 3 when the
# scan-surface discovery failed.
# gaia:maintainer-only:start
#
# Enforced by the sibling bats suite
# .gaia/scripts/tests/lint-collapsed-signal-trap.bats, which the `Audit CI Tests`
# scripts shard runs, and folded into .gaia/tests/shell-lint.sh so every
# shell-lint caller enforces the class. Also runnable directly:
# `bats .gaia/scripts/tests/lint-collapsed-signal-trap.bats`.
# gaia:maintainer-only:end
#
# Why: bash resumes at the point of interruption once a trapped signal handler
# RETURNS. A handler shared between EXIT and a terminating signal therefore
# deletes the disposition it replaced -- the default for INT and TERM is to
# terminate the process, and after the shared arm runs, the script simply carries
# on as though no signal arrived. The observable outcome is a script that cannot
# be interrupted, and it is silent: the cleanup the author wrote does happen, so
# the handler looks like it worked.
#
# The demand is a CLOSED RULE rather than a judgment about any one handler body,
# and the reason is that no shared arm can be correct. The handler either returns,
# which is the uninterruptible case above, or it exits, which gives the wrong
# status on the ordinary EXIT path the same arm also serves. There is no third
# behaviour, so a shared arm is wrong whatever its body does, and the gate needs
# to read only the signal list.
#
# The repair is one arm per disposition, the shape the tree already uses:
#
#     trap 'rm -f -- "$tmp"' EXIT
#     trap 'exit 130' INT
#     trap 'exit 143' TERM
#
# The signal arms exit, which runs the EXIT arm, which owns the cleanup. 130 and
# 143 are the conventional 128+SIGNUM statuses a shell reports for a process
# killed by SIGINT and SIGTERM.
#
# What this gate does NOT flag, each a closed property of the call text:
#
#   trap - SIGSPEC   -- removal, which RESTORES the default disposition. It is
#                       the opposite of the defect, not a weaker form of it.
#   trap -p / -l     -- query forms. They install nothing.
#   a single arm     -- `trap ... EXIT` alone, `trap ... INT` alone. The class is
#                       the SHARING, not either signal.
#
# Provenance: the class was repaired by hand twice in gaia-react/gaia#1716, in
# .gaia/scripts/audit-respawn-prune.sh and .gaia/scripts/lint-guard-rule-shell-
# coverage.sh, and each repair was pinned by a per-file assertion in that
# script's own sibling suite. Each pin greps one hardcoded path, so the rule they
# encoded was armed for exactly two files -- the hand-kept list
# .claude/rules/guards-must-fail.md names as an arming-stage failure. The third
# instance, in .specify/extensions/gaia/lib/with-ledger-lock.sh, sat unreached by
# any of it; gaia-react/gaia#1717 is the issue that replaced the two pins with
# this tree-wide gate.
#
# Scan surface: tracked `*.sh`, the extensionless husky hooks, the workflow and
# composite-action YAML whose `run:` bodies are shell by another name, the
# adopter workflow templates under
# .gaia/cli/src/automation/templates/workflows/, and tracked `*.bats`, collected
# as its own set below. The templates render into an ADOPTER's CI, where a
# collapsed arm is this class one distribution hop further out; that is the same
# reason the sibling run-interpolation and grep-escape gates scan them.
#
# `.gaia/cli/templates/workflows/` is a build artifact copied from `src/` by
# `bundle:adopter` and is deliberately NOT scanned, so no hit is reported twice
# and no report names a file the repair must not hand-edit.
#
# `*.md` is deliberately OUT of the surface, unlike the sibling path-quoting
# gate. That gate scans fenced blocks because several tracked pages are executed
# instruction an agent runs verbatim. A `trap` is not that: it configures a
# long-lived script, and this repository's markdown carries the collapsed shape
# only as the counter-example a page is explaining. Claiming markdown would red
# the gate on documentation of its own class, which is how a gate gets bypassed
# rather than fixed.
#
# The convention behind this file's `*.bats` argument-region discrimination and
# its pragma is recorded once, in
# wiki/decisions/Shell Guard Fixture Discrimination.md.

#
# Known blind spots, stated rather than discovered later and split by which way
# they fail, because that is the part that matters.
#
# FAIL-OPEN, each one a call the scan cannot read:
#   - A signal list continued onto the next line with a trailing backslash. The
#     scan is line-oriented, so it sees a list that stops at the continuation.
#   - A call assembled through a variable (`$TRAP_CMD`, `eval "trap ..."`), which
#     is tokenizer-bound the same way every sibling gate says of its own class.
#   - A `trap` inside a command substitution on a line whose earlier text opens a
#     quote. The command-position test counts quotes per line, so it reads that
#     token as data. A trap installed inside `$( )` binds the SUBSHELL rather
#     than the script, so nothing this gate exists to protect is at risk there.
#   - A handler written as an ANSI-C literal carrying a backslash-escaped single
#     quote (`$\047...\\\047...\047`). The handler skip reads the escaped quote as
#     the terminator, so the signal list it then walks is the literal tail rather
#     than the real list.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED, so each costs a correct edit and never a missed defect:
#   - An empty handler (`trap "" EXIT INT`), which is a deliberate IGNORE rather
#     than a cleanup. It is still the uninterruptible shape, and the repair is
#     still one arm per disposition, so the demand is right; it is listed here
#     because the author did not write a handler body and may not read the
#     message as describing what they wrote.
#
# FALSE POSITIVE, the third direction:
#   - Prose or a pattern in which `trap` stands at a statement boundary with EXIT
#     and INT after it, on a line whose quotes balance. No such line exists in
#     this tree, which the gate running clean over its own suite is what proves.
