#
# Enforced by the sibling bats suite
# .gaia/scripts/tests/lint-sigpipe-readers.bats, which the `Audit CI Tests`
# scripts shard runs, and folded into .gaia/tests/shell-lint.sh. Its arming
# takes MORE than that gate's `**/*.sh` paths-filter entry, which reaches only
# half of what this gate reads: the workflow, composite-action and adopter
# template entries beside it are what arm the other half, and each names this
# guard. A pull request touching only a workflow that skipped this gate would
# green it having read the very file it changed zero times. Also runnable
# directly: `bats .gaia/scripts/tests/lint-sigpipe-readers.bats`.
# gaia:maintainer-only:end
#
# Why: a short-circuiting reader INVERTS the truth value of the pipeline it
# terminates. `grep -q` exits at its first match and closes the read end of the
# pipe. When the upstream has written more than the pipe buffer (~64KB) and the
# match lands early, the upstream takes SIGPIPE and exits 141; `set -o pipefail`
# promotes that to the pipeline's status, so an `if` or an `&&` reading it takes
# the FALSE branch BECAUSE a match was found. Nothing surfaces it: the pipeline
# is well-formed, both commands did what they were asked, and the wrong branch
# looks exactly like the right one.
#
# Whether a given upstream can outrun the buffer is a data-flow property no
# static check can decide, so this gate does not try. It flags the SHAPE, with
# no discrimination, and that is affordable because the remedy is unconditional
# and free: each repair removes the pipeline outright rather than making the
# race safer, so the class cannot recur on the repaired line. A printf or echo
# feeding the reader becomes a here-string; a command feeding it is captured
# into a variable first; a filter feeding it folds into a single awk pass.
#
# That is the same trade .gaia/scripts/lint-hook-array-guard.sh already makes
# for a class it likewise cannot fully discriminate: a flagged site the author
# believes is genuinely safe takes the fix anyway, so the gate stays
# zero-exception rather than carrying an inline suppression. There is
# deliberately NO pragma.
#
# One trap in the repair itself, because `<<<` appends a newline. That is
# byte-identical to a `printf` of the same value with a trailing newline and
# harmless for an ordinary pattern, but an INVERTED reader (`grep -qv`) reads
# the extra trailing blank line as a non-matching line and then succeeds
# unconditionally. Trim the newline off the value, or fold the whole pipeline
# into one awk pass.
#
# Provenance: four known occurrences before this gate existed, three of them in
# guard machinery, where the failure mode is a guard reporting clean over a live
# defect. gaia-react/gaia#745 (`audit-success-present.sh`, fixed by
# gaia-react/gaia#748), gaia-react/gaia#757 and gaia-react/gaia#761 (two shapes
# in `audit-noop-detect.sh`), and the first draft of
# .gaia/scripts/lint-hook-advisory-classification.sh, which classified with a
# filtering grep feeding a quiet one and reported clean over the very defect it
# was written for, on its first run against the live tree. Each of the first
# three was patched in place with no gate left behind, which is why the fourth
# had nothing to catch it. gaia-react/gaia#1810 is the issue that replaced the
# patches with this tree-wide gate.
#
# Nothing else in the tree reaches the class. shellcheck at the `*.sh` severity
# floor .gaia/tests/shell-lint.sh sets returns exit 0 on a fixture carrying both
# shapes, and the `code-audit-maintainer-shell` agent has caught it once but is
# model-dispatched and advisory, so nothing enforced it.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHICH FILES RUN UNDER PIPEFAIL, which is a closure and not a per-file test
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `pipefail` is a shell OPTION, not a file attribute: it belongs to the process,
# and a sourced library therefore runs under whatever its caller armed. A gate
# that asked only whether the scanned file carries its own `set -o pipefail`
# would report every library clean, and `.claude/hooks/lib/` is exactly where
# three of the four historical occurrences above lived. That is an arming-stage
# hole in the sense .claude/rules/guards-must-fail.md names: correct wherever it
# runs, and never run on the surface that most needs it.
#
# So a file counts as running under pipefail when it arms pipefail itself, OR
# when it is reachable by `source` from a file that does. The seeds are the
# self-arming files; the edges are the `.`/`source` loads; the closure is
# transitive, because a library sourced by a library sourced by an armed entry
# point runs armed too.
#
# "Arms pipefail itself" means at command-substitution depth ZERO, the same test
# the workflow arm applies to a `run:` body and for the same reason: a
# `changed=$(set -o pipefail; ...)` arms its own subshell and nothing outside
# it, so a file whose only arming is that idiom is not a seed. The two arms
# share one arming test rather than two that agree by inspection
# (`arms_at_depth_zero` below); gaia-react/gaia#1941 is the round where the
# script arm got it. What that costs is stated with the depth test itself.
#
# An edge resolves by BASENAME against the tracked set, because a load names its
# target through a variable far more often than not
# (`. "$lib_dir/guard-awk-lib.sh"`), and no static reader can resolve that
# variable. Two consequences, both stated rather than hidden. A basename shared
# by two tracked files draws an edge to both, so one armed caller can mark a
# same-named file it never loads: that direction costs a correct edit and never
# a missed defect, which is the direction a guard may be wrong in. And a load
# whose target is built entirely from variables, with no literal `*.sh` token on
# the line, draws no edge at all; a file reachable only that way is not covered.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Scan surface
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Two sets the shared library defines, read as two arms because they decide
# arming differently: tracked `*.sh` (`shell`), and the Actions workflows,
# composite actions and adopter workflow templates (`workflows`). Two surfaces
# are deliberately outside both:
#
#   *.bats            bats-core arms no pipefail by DEFAULT, so an ordinary
#                     suite does not run the class. A suite that arms pipefail
#                     itself does, and that is out of scope by choice rather
#                     than by impossibility: the suites doing it today arm it
#                     inside a command substitution or a `bash -c` fixture,
#                     where the shape is the fixture rather than the suite.
#   the husky hooks   `.husky/_/h` runs each one as `sh -e`, which arms no
#                     pipefail either.
#
# What this gate does NOT try to decide: whether the pipeline's status is read
# as a truth value at all. A status nobody reads makes the shape harmless rather
# than absent, and separating the two needs the surrounding control flow. The
# remedy costs the same either way, so the shape is reported wherever it stands.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE WORKFLOW ARM, whose arming is a shell oracle rather than a text test
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A `run:` body is shell by another name, and it carries this class exactly as a
# script does. What it does NOT carry is the script arm's arming signal: a body
# inherits pipefail from the step's RESOLVED SHELL rather than from any text in
# it. GitHub's default `run:` shell is `bash -e`, which arms no pipefail; an
# explicit `shell: bash` resolves to `bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail`,
# which does. So the body-text test alone would grade every block by whether its
# author happened to write a redundant `set -o pipefail`.
#
# A block is therefore armed when EITHER holds, and the two are independent:
#
#   the resolved shell   the step's own `shell:` value is `bash`, or is a custom
#                        invocation naming `pipefail`. Anything else, including
#                        the absent case that covers every workflow-file step in
#                        this tree, is the bare `bash -e` default and arms
#                        nothing. `shell:` is read at the STEP's own key column,
#                        so the `shell:` that names a dorny/paths-filter filter
#                        inside a `filters: |` block scalar is not mistaken for
#                        one (.github/workflows/shell-lint.yml has two).
#   the body text        the block's own `set -o pipefail`, in the spellings the
#                        script arm already reads. A body that arms pipefail is
#                        armed whatever its shell resolves to.
#
# The substitution-scoped form `changed=$(set -o pipefail; ...)` must NOT arm
# the block around it, and the distinction is not academic: it is the shape this
# tree writes, and reading it as block-level arming would report every one of
# those blocks. So the body-text test fires only at command-substitution depth
# zero, tracked by counting `$(` against `)` across the block and clamped at
# zero. The clamp is what makes a miscount safe rather than merely bounded: a
# stray `)` (a `case` pattern, an arithmetic `))`) can only push the depth DOWN
# toward zero, which reads a substitution-scoped `set` as block-level and
# reports a block that was not armed. That direction costs a correct edit; the
# other direction is the missed defect this gate exists to prevent.
#
# The script arm applies the same depth test to a FILE, and TWO shapes reach the
# same accepted blind spot through it. Both are false negatives, the direction
# this gate must not be wrong in, so neither is left implied by the other.
#
# The first is a multi-line
#
#     out="$(
#       set -o pipefail
#       ...one pipeline into a quiet reader...
#     )"
#
# in a tracked script. It genuinely runs armed inside that subshell, and the
# depth test reads it as arming nothing, so the reader inside goes unreported.
# Before the depth test the script arm caught it by ACCIDENT, by over-arming the
# whole file on any arming it saw anywhere. This arm invents nothing here: the
# identical shape in a `run:` body already reads clean, so what changed is that
# the two arms now agree about it.
#
# The second is an UNBALANCED literal `$(` sitting on an earlier non-comment
# line, in a `grep -F` pattern or a `printf` template rather than in real code.
# The carry is a plain character count, so it cannot tell a quoted one from a
# live one, and the depth it hands the next line never returns to zero: a
# genuine file-level `set -euo pipefail` below it reads at depth above zero and
# does not arm, and every reader in that file goes unreported. This one is NOT
# inherited from the workflow arm by analogy, it is the same defect standing on
# both arms, since that arm carries `subdepth` across a block the same way and
# has since gaia-react/gaia#1936. Closing it needs the carry computed from a
# copy of the line with single-quoted spans removed, in both arms, which is a
# behaviour change on a live tree rather than a comment, so it is tracked
# separately rather than folded in here.
#
# Neither shape has an instance in this tree: no tracked shell file changes
# arming status on either, and no file ends a line with a net-positive literal
# depth. The balanced case, a whole `$( ... )` inside one quoted argument, is
# NOT affected and is pinned by a fixture, because it is the half that has to
# keep working for the carry to be worth having at all.
#
# `defaults.run.shell`, at job or workflow level, would move the resolved shell
# for every step under it. This gate REFUSES rather than resolves it: a
# BLOCK-STYLE `defaults:` key anywhere in the scanned YAML exits 4 naming
# gaia-react/gaia#1814. Block-style is the honest qualifier rather than a
# hedge, because it is exactly what the reader below sees: it takes one leading
# mapping key per line, so a flow-style `jobs: {j: {defaults: ...}}` reads as
# the key `jobs` and its nested `defaults:` is never seen. No flow-style
# workflow YAML exists here, and the same one-key-per-line reading is what every
# other structural answer this arm gives is built on. There are zero in this tree, so the refusal costs
# nothing today, and it converts an unimplemented precedence chain into a loud
# stop rather than a silent wrong answer. That is this tree's own idiom, the
# same shape gaia-react/gaia#1880's `--show-prefix` refusal takes ahead of
# discovery. Implementing the chain is a change for the day a `defaults:` key
# first appears, and this diagnostic is what will name it.
#
# BOTH `run:` spellings are scanned. A block scalar is graded when the block
# ends; an inline value is a single command, so it is its own one-line block and
# is graded on the spot. Grading only the block form would leave the inline one
# unscanned at every arming, and a composite step is precisely where that
# matters: the Actions schema makes `shell:` mandatory there, so a `shell: bash`
# arms an inline reader exactly as it arms a block one.
#
# Known blind spots on this surface, stated rather than discovered later, and
# both of them FALSE NEGATIVES. A `run:` whose value is a multi-line plain or
# quoted flow scalar has only its first line read, the rest being scanned as
# though they were not part of the value. A mustache partial include inside a
# body ends the scan there. Both mirror
# .gaia/scripts/lint-workflow-run-interpolation.sh, which states its own version
# of each and scans the same two arms, and neither shape appears in this tree.
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible. Never `cd`.

# asks of it: which mapping key is this line, and is this line inside a block
# scalar rather than a key at all. Sets keyname, keycol and islist; answers 0
# when the line carries no key to read.
#
# The block-scalar half is load-bearing rather than tidiness, and which cases
# need it is a criterion rather than a list: any caller that acts on this
# answer without the step-column test gating it reads a key at ANY column, so
# it has nothing to fall back on, and a `run:` body carrying whatever shape
# that caller keys on, a quoted keyword or a dash-led item alike, would be
# taken for the key itself. Both passes below carry such callers, the `islist`
# arm among them, since the arm that sets the step column necessarily runs
# ahead of the test against it, and it keys on the dash rather than on any
# word. Take them off the call sites rather than off a list here, which goes
# stale the round another one is added. It is NOT what saves the two lines
# spelled `shell:` inside the `filters: |` body of
# .github/workflows/shell-lint.yml, tempting as that reading is. Block-scalar
# content is necessarily indented deeper than the key that opened it, and that
# key is already deeper than the step column, so the step-column test decides
