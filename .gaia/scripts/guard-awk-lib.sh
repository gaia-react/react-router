#
# Enforced by the sibling bats suite beside this file, which the `Audit CI Tests`
# scripts shard runs. The convention this library exists to hold, and the
# reasoning behind the argument-region rule and the pragma, live in
# wiki/decisions/Shell Guard Fixture Discrimination.md.
# gaia:maintainer-only:end
#
# Why a library of awk SOURCE rather than of bash functions: every consuming
# guard detects its class inside a single-quoted awk program and holds its
# per-line state in awk variables. A bash function can supply none of that state,
# so what is shared has to be awk text a guard concatenates ahead of its own
# program. The sibling errexit guard already demonstrates the shape in-file,
# joining its shared detector to a per-surface program at call time.
#
# Why the name does not begin with `lint-`: the whole-tree-invariant sweep reads
# `check-*.sh`, `audit-*-complete.sh`, `lint-*.sh` and `verify-*.sh` under
# .gaia/scripts as whole-tree-check candidates and demands a roster row for each.
# This file is not a check, so it takes the `*-lib.sh` naming its siblings in
# this directory use and is swept by nothing. No count is given deliberately: the
# set grows, and a number here names a set nothing recounts.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The contract a consuming guard is written against
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Bash surface: the readonly `GAIA_GUARD_AWK` (the awk source), and
# `gaia_guard_bats_files <label>`, which fills the global array
# `GAIA_GUARD_BATS_FILES` and returns non-zero on an empty bats surface or a
# working directory below the repository root. The caller reads that status
# directly, and forwards it rather than flattening it, so the two stay tellable
# apart at the exit code:
#
#     gaia_guard_bats_files my-guard || exit $?
#
# An array rather than a NUL stream on stdout, because bash discards NUL bytes in
# a command substitution and reading the stream through a process substitution
# swallows the function status, which is the hazard every consuming guard already
# documents at its own discovery loop. The read loop stays inside the function so
# NUL safety never crosses a boundary, and the array name is a fixed global
# because bash 3.2 has no nameref.
#
# Awk surface, and the only names a guard may call: gaia_scan_reset,
# gaia_scan_prepass, gaia_scan_prepass_end, gaia_scan_feed, gaia_scan_skip,
# gaia_scan_suppressed, gaia_scan_pragma_here, gaia_scan_run_only,
# gaia_scan_end. Every invocation passes `-v file=`, `-v is_bats=` and
# `-v scripts_dir=`.
#
# Two passes over a bats file, one over everything else. A fixture constant is
# bound far above the helper call that consumes it, so a forward-only scan cannot
# classify it; the guard names the file twice and guards its first pass with
# `is_bats && NR == FNR { gaia_scan_prepass($0); next }`.
#
# `gaia_scan_feed` MUST be the first statement of the guard main rule, ahead of
# every `next`. The pragma reader lives behind it and has to see the full-line
# comments a class detector discards; a guard that skips comments first silently
# loses every pragma in the file.
#
# Line numbers are FNR, never NR. Under the two-pass invocation a pass-2 line NR
# is `file_length + FNR`, so a guard reporting NR is wrong by a whole file length
# on every bats hit. On a single-pass surface the two are equal by construction,
# which is why the switch is safe to make unconditionally.
#
# Every internal global is prefixed `G_`. Awk has no scoping and the errexit
# guard already occupies `W_*`, so an unprefixed global here would collide with a
# consumer rather than with a sibling.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The argument-region rule, stated closed
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# In a `*.bats` file a line is DATA, and gaia_scan_skip answers 1, when and only
# when the statement occupying it is one of:
#
#   - a call whose command word is a recognized fixture-writing helper;
#   - a `cat`, `printf` or `echo` carrying a top-level output redirect;
#   - an assignment whose name the prepass saw handed to such a helper and never
#     saw in an execution position, and whose value opens with a single-quote
#     family literal;
#   - the body of a heredoc whose delimiter was quoted.
#
# Everything else is shell and is reported. The rule names SHAPES, never files, so
# a new suite inherits the behavior with no registration anywhere, and a fixture
# written through a helper the set does not name reds until someone extends the
# set or writes a pragma. The region runs from the command word to the end of the
# STATEMENT, joining backslash continuations and spanning multi-line quoted
# literals, because a fixture literal carrying the class on an interior line is
# the ordinary shape rather than the exotic one.
#
# End of statement, not end of line, and the difference is load-bearing. A
# top-level `;`, `&&` or `||` starts a second statement the suite executes, so a
# line carrying one is never skipped even when it opens with a fixture writer.
# Reading the region to end of line instead classified that second statement as
# data and skipped a real instance on it, on the one surface this library exists
# to arm. Top-level is what makes this safe to enforce: a separator inside a
# quoted literal or a substitution is consumed by the walk before the test sees
# it, which is why the hundreds of fixture bodies in this tree that contain a
# semicolon are unaffected.
#
# The exclusion term on the assignment arm is the whole mechanism that keeps
# executed shell out: a variable body later handed to `bash -c` or `eval` is
# never data, however it was written. That is the shape that shipped a live
# unquoted call inside a suite and survived four rounds of review.
#
# The value must open with `'` or `$'`. A double-quoted value can carry a command
# substitution, so admitting it would let a line that RUNS something be classified
# as a literal; this is a narrowing of the frozen rule, and it fails closed.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The pragma
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Literal form, on the comment line or lines immediately above the target:
# a `#`, then `gaia-lint-ignore` as the first token, then the guard token, a
# colon, and a mandatory reason. The token is the guard script basename with the
# extension stripped.
#
# `gaia-lint-ignore` must be the FIRST token after the `#`. That is what lets a
# guard header, a changelog, or a wiki page write the word inline in prose
# without creating a live pragma on a scanned surface.
#
# Token resolution is against `<scripts_dir>/<token>.sh`, from the `-v
# scripts_dir=` variable, and never against a cwd-relative path. Every fixture
# test in every consuming suite runs its guard with cwd inside a throwaway repo
# that carries no .gaia/scripts, so cwd-relative resolution would read every
# well-formed token as orphaned and fail every honored-pragma test. Resolution is
# by readability rather than by execute permission, because these guards are not
# mode-executable and awk cannot stat; the verdict is cached per token.
#
# A following comment line whose first token is NOT the keyword continues the
# reason. One whose first token IS the keyword stacks a second pragma on the same
# target. A BLANK line terminates the block, leaving every pragma in it unused.
# An ordinary comment line does not terminate it, because a wrapped reason is
# textually an ordinary comment line and the two are not distinguishable. The
# target is the first non-comment, non-blank line beneath the block.
#
# What is bats-only and what is not: the fixture-region rule, suppression, the
# run-only exemption and the desync verdict are inert when is_bats is 0. Pragma
# BLOCK parsing runs on every surface, so gaia_scan_pragma_here answers on a
# `*.sh`, husky, workflow-YAML or markdown line and the naming guard can report a
# pragma that is honored nowhere. Malformed-pragma errors are not bats-scoped
# either: the designated owner emits them wherever it finds them, so a malformed
# pragma anywhere in the tree is seen exactly once. The UNUSED-pragma error is
# bats-scoped, because outside `*.bats` nothing can consume a pragma and the
# honored-nowhere finding already covers that line.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ANSI-C quoting, and the two decisions a second tokenizer has to agree with
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ANSI-C quoting, the dollar-prefixed single-quote form, is not ordinary
# single-quoting: inside it a backslash
# escapes, so an escaped quote does NOT close the literal. Read as an ordinary
# span it closes at the escaped quote and reopens at the real terminator, leaving
# the state inverted for the rest of the file. It gets a frame of its own here,
# entered the moment the opening quote is seen immediately after an unquoted `$`.
# This is not theoretical: the fixture literals in the path-quoting suite are
# written in exactly that form.
#
# Decision 1, a literal opened at the very start of a continued line. Quote state
# carries across a backslash continuation, and the opener is recognized at index
# 1 of the continued line exactly as it is mid-line. The one shape not covered is
# an opener SPLIT by the continuation, the `$` as the last character before the
# trailing backslash and the quote as the first character of the next line; it is
# read as an ordinary single quote. Leaving it out is deliberate rather than
# missed: it fails into the desync verdict rather than into silence, and a second
# tokenizer that implemented it would disagree with this one about what the same
# bytes mean.
#
# Decision 2, a `$` that is itself escaped or quoted. The frame opens only from
# the unquoted state and only on a `$` the walk actually reaches. A
# backslash-escaped `$` is consumed by the escape arm, so an escaped dollar
# followed by a quote opens an ordinary single-quoted span. A `$` inside single
# quotes is literal and the quote that follows it CLOSES that span rather than
# opening a new frame. A `$` inside double quotes never opens the frame, because
# bash does not expand ANSI-C quoting there.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Blind spots, split by which way each fails
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# FAIL-CLOSED, so each costs a correct edit and never a missed defect:
#   - A fixture written through a helper outside the recognized set, or into an
#     UNQUOTED heredoc, is read as executed shell. That is the rule doing its
#     job; the repair is to extend the set or to write a pragma.
#   - A `cat`/`printf`/`echo` whose redirect sits on a later line of a continued
#     statement is not recognized as a writer, because the redirect is read from
#     the statement first line only.
#   - An assignment whose value opens with a double quote is never data.
#   - A line that opens with a fixture writer and then carries a top-level `;`,
#     `&&` or `||` is reported whole, rather than split at the separator, and so
#     is every continuation line of that second statement. The region rule
#     answers per line, so a line that is half evidence and half executed shell
#     is read as shell; a fixture that genuinely needs to share a line with a
#     second statement takes a pragma.
#
# FAIL-OPEN, and each is a place the discriminator can hand a guard a false
# clean:
#   - A function invoked only from inside a string (`bash -c "helper"`) is not
#     counted as invoked, so a helper otherwise called only through `run` keeps
#     its exemption. The run-only accessor answers 0 for a function with no
#     invocation at all, which is the closed direction for the ordinary case.
#   - Function bodies are closed by a `}` at column 1. A suite that indents its
#     closing brace carries its function scope further than it should.
#   - A name marked as executed anywhere in the file is executed everywhere in
#     it. That direction is closed for the region rule and open for nothing else.
#
# NEITHER, because they end in the desync verdict rather than in a verdict about
# a line: more than one heredoc opened on a single line, and the split ANSI-C
# opener above. An unread region leaves a quote, a substitution, a continuation
# or a heredoc open at end of input, and gaia_scan_end says so rather than
# letting a guard certify a file it never classified.

#   2  the call itself is wrong: a set name this library does not know, no set
#      named at all, one named twice, or a working directory below the
#      repository root. Any of them leaves the guard scanning a surface other
#      than the one it asked for and still reporting clean, which is the
#      discovery-stage failure `.claude/rules/guards-must-fail.md` names.
#   3  the discovery machinery failed: a named set's own `git ls-files`, the
#      sort, or the scratch file each of them needs. Distinct from 1 because
#      the repairs differ, and distinct from a partial result because a set
#      that returned nothing on a failed call is otherwise indistinguishable
#      from one that legitimately matched nothing: with several sets asked for,
#      the survivors would carry the result past the empty check and the gate
#      would report clean over a surface it never opened.
#
# It really is a union: naming a set twice is refused rather than concatenated,
# so no path can reach the array twice and be scanned and reported twice. Across
# distinct names the sets are disjoint by construction, which is what lets the
# sort below leave out `-u`; a `-u` there would be a second mechanism
# guaranteeing the same thing, and a suite cannot red on either one alone while
# the other still holds.
#
# Nothing here is read through a process substitution, whose subshell cannot
# return its status to this function. That is what leaves a failure
# indistinguishable from an empty result, so every stage writes to a scratch
# file whose producer's status is read before the next stage runs. Every return
