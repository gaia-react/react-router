#
# Report security floors that have stopped being applied in a pnpm workspace
# root outside the repository root.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Every dependency-CVE surface in this repository runs
# `pnpm audit` from the repository root and nowhere else: the `/update-deps`
# skill's override audit, the code-review agent's advisory oracle, and the CI
# cron template. A second workspace root is invisible to all of them, because a
# root's own pnpm-workspace.yaml is what makes it a separate root in the first
# place, so root's closure never contains it. `.gaia/cli` is such a root, its
# overrides map carries security floors retired by hand, and its build inlines
# its dependencies into a binary adopters receive. Nothing reported on it.
#
# WHY IT IS A SEPARATE PROGRAM RATHER THAN A WIDER `/update-deps`. That skill
# ships to adopters, and every file constituting the second root is
# release-excluded, so an adopter has no second root to audit. Teaching the
# shipped skill about one would encode a condition that can never arise on an
# adopter's machine. An earlier attempt at the retrofit was also reverted after
# the graft ran against the grain of a skill that is single-root in every phase.
#
# THE ARMS, AND THEY FAIL DIFFERENTLY ON PURPOSE.
#
#   Parity, offline and deterministic, and it decides the exit status. The
#   overrides map in the root's pnpm-workspace.yaml must match the overrides
#   block in its lockfile exactly. Drift either way means the floor named in
#   config is not the floor the tree resolves against, which is a security pin
#   that looks present and is not. The `/update-deps` skill closes its own
#   override audit with this same assertion, against the repository root only.
#
#   Advisory, needs the network, and by default does NOT decide the exit
#   status. It surfaces high and critical advisories in the root's closure.
#   Reporting-not-blocking is the posture every other local `pnpm audit` in this
#   repository already takes.
#
#   THE ADVISORY ARM IS NOT RUN ON ANY PULL REQUEST, and that is measured rather
#   than cautious. Across four runs of the job that gates this check it reached
#   the registry twice and failed twice, taking between 107s and 251s either
#   way, so its duration says nothing about whether it worked. It is a network
#   call inside a declared-required context whose own cap it competes for,
#   buying a result about half the time. That job therefore passes `--no-audit`
#   and gates on the parity arm alone.
#
#   IT DOES RUN ON A SCHEDULE, on its own non-required lane
#   (.github/workflows/cli-advisory-scan.yml), which is where the measurement
#   above stops being an argument against running it: no pull request waits on
#   that lane, so a multi-minute call and a coin-flip reach rate cost nothing,
#   and the lane retries rather than reporting a registry outage as a result.
#   A maintainer still runs the arm by hand the same way.
#
#   THAT LANE NEEDS THE STATUS, which `--advisory-strict` is for. A scheduled
#   job's only channel to a human is its conclusion, so an arm that reports
#   without deciding reaches nobody there: the run goes green having found a
#   critical advisory and printed it into a log nothing reads. Under the flag
#   the arm's outcome becomes the exit status, and the two outcomes get
#   different statuses because the caller does different things with them, one
#   is retried and the other is alerted on. Parity still outranks both: it is
#   the offline, deterministic verdict, and sending someone to the registry for
#   a cause sitting in the lockfile is the wrong direction.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH, and saying so is load-bearing rather than modest. A
# floor whose parents have bumped their own pins past it stops being a floor and
# quietly becomes a cap, holding a dependency BELOW what the tree would resolve
# on its own. That decay passes the parity arm untouched, because config and
# lockfile still agree with each other. Detecting it means toggling each key out
# and re-resolving with `pnpm dedupe`, which rewrites the lockfile -- a check
# that runs in CI must not mutate the tree, so the toggle stays where it is, in
# the interactive skill. A green run here means the floors are applied, never
# that they are still needed.
#
# Exit status: 0 nothing to report, 1 a floor is not applied as configured,
# 2 the check could not do what it was asked -- the root could not be read, the
# arguments were wrong, or, under --advisory-strict, a tool the advisory arm
# needs is absent from PATH so that arm never ran. Under --advisory-strict only,
# and only when the parity arm found nothing: 3 the advisory arm found a high or
# critical advisory, 4 the advisory arm could not read a report and this closure
# was therefore not audited. 3 and 4 are the pair a caller retries; 2 is not.

usage: check-cli-workspace-floors.sh [--no-audit | --advisory-strict] [<workspace-root>]

  <workspace-root>   a directory holding its own pnpm-workspace.yaml and

  --no-audit         run the parity arm only; do not reach the network.
  --advisory-strict  let the advisory arm decide the exit status when the parity
                     arm found nothing: 3 an advisory was found, 4 no report
                     could be read. For a caller whose only channel is its own
                     exit status. Contradicts --no-audit.

# gaia_cwf_overrides <yaml-file>
#   Print the file's top-level `overrides:` mapping as normalized
#   <key><TAB><value> lines, sorted. Prints nothing when the file declares no
#   overrides block. Returns 2, having said why, when the file cannot be read.
#
#   THIS READS WITH js-yaml, THE LIBRARY THAT WROTE THE FILE, and that is the
#   whole point rather than a convenience. pnpm serializes pnpm-lock.yaml with
#   js-yaml, which is verifiable: dumping an overrides map through the copy in
#   .gaia/cli/node_modules reproduces the live lockfile block byte-identically,
#   quoting included. Reading it back with the same library makes the question
#   "does this reader know that YAML shape" disappear rather than moving it.
#
#   It replaced a hand-rolled awk recognizer, and the reason is measured, not
#   stylistic: six consecutive audit rounds each found the recognizer reading a
#   different legal shape wrong, and every one of them printed a verdict rather
#   than refusing. Key termination, a comment tail folded into a version, the
#   line between plain and quoted scalars, an annotated block header, and then
#   three more spellings of that same header, each of which js-yaml reads
#   correctly and the recognizer reported clean over an unapplied floor. Fixing
#   a spelling produced the next spelling; that is what says the instrument was
#   wrong rather than any one of its readings.
#
#   FAILSAFE_SCHEMA, not the default. Under the default schema `1.10` loads as
#   the number 1.1, and the report would then print a version the file does not
#   contain. The failsafe schema resolves every scalar as a string, which is
#   what a version specifier is.
#
#   NO SILENT DEGRADATION. If node or js-yaml is missing this returns 2 and says
#   so; it never falls back to a weaker reader, because a weaker reader is
#   exactly what the six rounds above were about.
