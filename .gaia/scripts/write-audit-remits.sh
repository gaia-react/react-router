# write-audit-remits.sh: generates each Code Audit Team member's remit region
# from the roster.
#
# Every member declares which files it owns twice: once in the roster
# (.gaia/audit-ci.yml), which decides dispatch and the clearance the merge gate
# demands, and once in its own .claude/agents/code-audit-<name>.md prose, which
# the spawned agent filters the changed-file list against. Nothing checks that
# the two agree, so they drift. This script makes the prose a GENERATED
# statement of the roster: it rewrites each member's marker-delimited remit
# region (between `<!-- gaia:audit-remit:start -->` and
# `<!-- gaia:audit-remit:end -->`) from the roster's raw globs, and is
# idempotent on an already-agreeing tree -- a second run changes nothing.
#
# It obtains the roster's raw globs from verify-audit-roster.sh's read-only
# `--emit-roster` mode rather than carrying a second YAML scrape: that mode
# reuses the check's own _verify_roster_read_globs reader, so the roster is
# parsed exactly twice between the two scripts (the scrape, and the
# classifier), never a third time here.
#
# It never modifies anything outside a member's remit markers. The one
# exception: a definition that carries no region yet, where it inserts one
# after the `## Remit and self-skip` heading (or, failing that, after the
# YAML frontmatter) and leaves everything else on the page untouched.
#
# A dispatched Code Audit Team member is denied this script entirely by
# .claude/hooks/block-selfheal-paths.sh: repairing a drifted remit is the
# orchestrator's action, taken between dispatches, never a member's own. A
# member that notices its region has drifted reports it as a finding instead.
#
# Reads the roster and each agent file; writes only inside a member's own
# markers, or inserts a fresh pair. Never touches the roster itself, the
# machinery lists, or any wiki page.
#
# DO NOT add `set -e` (matches verify-audit-roster.sh): several checks below
# rely on grep and comparison exit status without aborting the script.
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible (macOS default): no associative arrays, no `mapfile`, no
# `${var^^}`. Never `cd` outside the source-time self-location resolution.

Usage: write-audit-remits.sh [--root <dir>] [--config <file>]
  --root <dir>     repo root. Default: the repo holding this script.
                   Injection point for the agent files.
  --config <file>  roster. Default: <root>/.gaia/audit-ci.yml.
                   Injection point for the roster.
  --help | -h      this text.

Exit codes:
  0  every member's region is in the generated state (whether or not
     anything changed).
  1  a hard failure: the check script is missing, the --emit-roster call
     failed, a definition's markers are duplicated, unbalanced, or reversed,
     the definition has no insertion anchor, region generation failed, or
     installing the regenerated file failed.
  2  usage error, including a roster that does not exist.
