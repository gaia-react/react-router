# Per-member scratch directory for a Code Audit Team member that needs real
# bytes on disk.
#
# The contract this exists to serve: every member returns the audited working
# tree unchanged, while establishing that a guard is not hollow means breaking
# the construct the guard names and watching a check go red. Those two compose
# into an obligation no member definition used to state -- the mutation has to
# happen on a copy, somewhere outside the tree under review -- and the only
# writable space a dispatched subagent is handed is the session scratchpad,
# which every member of one parallel wave shares. A member improvising a name
# there picks the name its co-dispatched siblings also pick, and one member's
# pristine copy lands over another's mutated one. Neither direction announces
# itself: a pristine tree over a mutated one makes the mutation look like it
# did not red (a fabricated hollow-assertion finding), and a mutated tree over
# a pristine one reds a test that has nothing to do with the change under
# review.
#
# So the path is minted here rather than described in prose. The key is the
# audit key PLUS the member name, the same pairing the findings sidecar
# already publishes under (.gaia/local/audit/<audit-key>.<member>.findings.json):
# the audit key alone is NOT enough, because every member of one wave resolves
# the same key, and it is exactly the member half that makes the name
# wave-safe by construction.
#
# Layout, under the MAIN checkout (.gaia/local/cache is main-anchored, the
# same root gh-artifact-lib.sh resolves):
#
#   <main_root>/.gaia/local/cache/mutation-scratch/<audit-key>.<member>/
#
# Registered as `audit-mutation-scratch` in .gaia/state-registry.json
# (cache/mutation-scratch/, prefix, dir, ephemeral). Two reapers, in that
# order of preference: gaia_audit_scratch_release, which a member calls when
# it is done, and the janitor's stale cache sweep
# (.claude/hooks/local-janitor.sh sweep #5b), which ages out a directory a
# member died before releasing. The release path is the real one; the sweep is
# the backstop for a member that never got there.
#
# Every function below prints nothing and returns 0 when it cannot resolve a
# path, the same fail-open rule audit-key-lib.sh and gh-artifact-lib.sh
# already apply: a caller that cannot be given a private directory must fall
# back to its own judgment, never to a shared path this file invented.
#
# ONE TREE, read in one place. The optional trailing <dir> selects the tree
# for both halves that are about the CALLER's tree: the audit key the path is
# minted under, and the tree the direct-run mint's worktree advisory
# describes. Both read it at the same `${3:-.}` default, so a half added
# beside them takes its tree from there too rather than resolving one of its
# own; what <dir> must never become is two arguments' worth of behaviour under
# one name. The scratch ROOT is the deliberate exception and not a third
# half: it is main-anchored by the layout above, so it answers to the main
# checkout rather than to any tree a caller names, and no <dir> reaches it.
#
# <dir> defaults to `.` and no shipped caller passes it, which is why the
# usage lines below do not offer it -- an undocumented argument earns no
# public contract.
#
# Usage, sourced:

#
# The member name is run through gaia_key_slug rather than interpolated raw.
# That is not cosmetic: the slug's percent-encoding of every byte outside
# [A-Za-z0-9_-] is what makes a member argument containing `/` or `..`
# incapable of escaping the scratch root, and this function's one caller
# class is an LLM-driven agent passing its own name through.
#
# An unresolvable audit key degrades to the literal `nokey` rather than
# declining outright, which is the one place this file's fail-open rule reads
# differently from the findings sidecar's. The sidecar declines its write
# because a report nobody can find under the expected key is worse than no
# report. A scratch directory has no reader but its own member, so the
# property that actually matters is the member half, and that half is intact
# with or without a key. Two sessions whose key is undeterminable can still
# collide on `nokey.<member>`; that is a strictly smaller population than the
# wave collision this exists to remove, and declining here would put the
# member back to improvising the name.

  # from Bash and succeeds; the caller's next step is an Edit or a Write, and
  # the runtime's own worktree confinement refuses a file_path that leaves the
  # tree. A caller told only the path reads a success and hits a refusal it
  # cannot place, whose stated remedy (edit the worktree copy) does not exist

  # Nothing in this repository can make that Write succeed: the refusal is the
