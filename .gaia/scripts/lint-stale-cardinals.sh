# The convention behind this file's argument-region discrimination and its
# pragma is recorded once, in wiki/decisions/Shell Guard Fixture Discrimination.md.
# gaia:maintainer-only:end
#
# Why: a bare count is a name for a set, and it decays the way a name does. The
# set grows, nothing recounts, and the number becomes a false claim a reader
# trusts precisely because it is specific. `.claude/rules/code-comments.md`
# (`## Counts`) states the rule and the remedy; this gate is what makes the
# requirement checkable rather than merely asserted, the same relationship
# .gaia/scripts/lint-shipped-issue-refs.sh has to that file's issue-reference
# section. `.claude/rules/bats-assertions.md` states the same prohibition for a
# `@test` name and for the comment describing a derived set, which is why a
# `@test` line is scanned here alongside a comment.
#
# The remedy, in the rule's own order of preference: name the members or point
# at what holds them and let the reader count; or, where the number genuinely
# carries the claim, add something that recounts it and leave the number
# self-correcting. Correcting a stale figure without adding the recount just
# restarts the decay from a fresher number.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What is a candidate, and why each narrowing is there
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A candidate is a DEFINITE DETERMINER, then a CARDINAL of at least three, then
# a REPO-ARTIFACT PLURAL NOUN, within a short window. Each of the three terms
# is a narrowing measured against this tree rather than assumed, because the
# naive predicate -- a number beside a plural noun -- fires in the high hundreds
# here and a gate nobody can keep green gets disabled.
#
# DEFINITE, not bare. This is the discriminator that makes the class separable
# at all. A bare cardinal is ordinary structural English: "two ways", "three
# things", "two arms" describe the shape of the argument being made in the very
# same comment, and the enumeration is right there, so the phrase is rewritten
# whenever it changes. A definite determiner is different in kind: a possessive
# or an all-quantifier binding a cardinal to a set the reader is expected to
# already know, of siblings, of hooks, of callers, asserts a cardinality for a
# specific population that lives somewhere else in the tree and moves without
# touching this sentence. Both instances of the class that were in reach on this
# surface carried a determiner, and so did every instance already standing in
# the tree when this gate was written; the bare-subject form ("Six subcommands
# answer here") is real, and the FAIL-OPEN list below is where it is accounted
# for rather than here. Dropping this term multiplies the report several-fold
# with nothing in the added set that a reader would call a defect.
#
# AT LEAST THREE. A pair is the one cardinality English spends as a structural
# word rather than as a measurement -- "the two sides", "the two halves", "the
# two consumers" -- and its enumeration is invariably adjacent. The rule's own
# worked examples all start above it. Admitting a cardinality of two roughly
# doubles the report and the added entries are overwhelmingly of that shape.
#
# A CLOSED NOUN VOCABULARY, in NOUNS below. Without it the report is dominated
# by nouns that name an abstraction rather than a countable artifact ("ways",
# "shapes", "halves", "reasons"), for which there is no set to recount and so no
# repair. The vocabulary names things this repository CONTAINS and a reader
# could go and count. It is deliberately a closed list rather than a
# morphological guess: a list that is short and wrong is visible, and a
# heuristic that is subtly wrong is not. Extending it is a one-line change, and
# an extension that reds the tree is the gate working.
#
# The predicate is defined once, in PRED_AWK below, and both surface programs
# call it. That is what keeps the two surfaces from disagreeing about what the
# class is: a vocabulary entry, a window width or a clause-ender rule added for
# one of them lands on the other in the same edit.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The scan surface, and what it leaves unscanned
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `.claude/rules/code-comments.md` binds a glob list, and this gate now reads
# every entry on it. Two readers, split by comment syntax rather than by glob:
#
# THE `#` READER, over tracked `*.sh` and `*.bats`: full-line comments, plus the
# `@test` name line. That covers the rule's `.gaia`, `.claude/hooks`, `.github`
# and `.specify` shell entries, and its `*.bats` entry. The shell pathspec is
# repo-wide rather than a transcription of those entries, so a script that moves
# out from under one of them stays scanned.
#
# THE `//` AND `/* */` READER, over the rule's C-family entries: `app`,
# `test`, `.playwright`, `.storybook` and `.gaia` TypeScript, JavaScript and
# CSS. CFAM_GLOBS below transcribes those entries, and the bats suite pins the
# transcription against the rule file so the two cannot drift apart silently.
#
# NEVER GOVERNED, which is a different claim and must not be read as a carve-out
# from the rule: Markdown appears in none of `code-comments.md`'s globs, so
# excluding it withholds nothing the rule ever asked for. The reason not to
# widen to it anyway is worth recording, because it is the surface a reader
# reaches for first. Tracked markdown here is dominated by DATED, FROZEN records
# -- CHANGELOG.md, wiki/log.md, and the wiki/meta/lint-report-*.md and
# staleness-audit-*.md series -- in which a cardinal is a true statement about
# the tree AS IT WAS on the day the entry was written. Recounting one against
# today's tree is not a repair; it falsifies a record whose whole value is that
# it does not move. The rule files that DEFINE this class are markdown too, and
# they quote the bad shape as a worked example. A gate there would demand edits
# with no correct answer on both populations, which is the shape that gets a
# gate switched off. Markdown would need a frozen-record exemption before it
# could pay, and that is a different gate rather than a wider pathspec on this
# one.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The pragma
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `gaia-lint-ignore lint-stale-cardinals: <reason>` on the comment line above a
# target waives it there and nowhere else; an unused one is reported. It is
# honored inside `*.bats` only, which is where a suite has to WRITE the bad
# shape as a fixture. Everywhere else the absence of an escape hatch is the
# point: the rule's remedies are always available, so a `*.sh` comment that
# cannot be reworded is a comment stating a count nothing keeps. A pragma
# NAMING THIS GUARD on either unhonored surface is reported as waiving nothing,
# so it fails visibly rather than going quietly inert. The qualifier is
# load-bearing rather than pedantic; the FAIL-OPEN list below carries what it
# leaves out.
#
# The literal form, the token-resolution rule, and the block-continuation rule
# are the shared library's, stated once in .gaia/scripts/guard-awk-lib.sh. The
# C-family reader has no library to consult, so it makes the same two-part
# recognition itself: `gaia-lint-ignore` must lead, AND the token after it must
# name this guard. Both halves are needed because the message it prints asserts
# THIS guard's honored-only-in-bats rule, which is a claim about a rule the
# author of a sibling guard's pragma was never invoking. What it does not need
# is the block grammar, since there is nothing to honor on that surface.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Blind spots, split by which way each fails
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# FAIL-OPEN, each a real instance this scan cannot read:
#   - A cardinal separated from its noun by more words than GAP_MAX below. The
#     window is short on purpose: widening it starts admitting a cardinal and a
#     noun that belong to different clauses of one sentence, which is a false
#     positive whose demanded repair points at the wrong phrase.
#   - A count expressed without a determiner the DET set names, most of all a
#     possessive noun phrase ("the gate's four callers") or a bare subject
#     ("Six subcommands answer here"). The definite-determiner term is what
#     buys the precision, and it is paid for with exactly this.
#   - A noun outside the closed vocabulary.
#   - A pragma on a C-family source naming a DIFFERENT guard. This one reports
#     only a pragma naming itself, for the reason the pragma section above
#     gives, and no library-backed guard scans this surface at all, so nothing
#     reports that line and it waives nothing in silence. The `*.sh` and `*.bats`
#     surfaces do not have this gap, because the sibling guards scanning them
#     each report their own. Closing it would mean one guard answering for
#     another guard's spelling, which is the sort of claim that goes stale
#     without anything failing.
#   - A cardinal and its noun split across two physical comment lines. The scan
#     reads one line at a time, so a phrase that wraps is two half-phrases and
#     neither one matches. This is not a rare shape: comments here wrap near 79
#     columns, and the shared library's own header carried a stale count in
#     exactly this position, which this gate could not see.
#
#     A two-line window was considered and declined, and the reason is NOT that
#     joining would lose the sentence-boundary protection: the clause-ender rule
#     below fires on an ender followed by whitespace OR by end of line, so a
#     whitespace-preserving join leaves that case exactly as protected, which a
#     probe confirms. The reason is the seam that carries no ender at all: a
#     bullet ending on a cardinal, above a separate bullet opening on a
#     vocabulary noun, joins into a phrase this predicate matches and no author
#     wrote. That is a false positive whose demanded repair points at a line
#     break rather than at any claim. Joining a wrap is the opposite case and is
#     what makes the window tempting, since it reconstructs the phrase the
#     author did write; one shape cannot be had without the other, so the wrap
#     is fixed by hand instead.
#   - An ordinal or a written-out range ("the fourth of five callers").
#   - A count in a trailing comment that shares its line with code. Both readers
#     take only a comment that OWNS its line: an instance written after a `#` or
#     a `//` that follows executable text is missed, and so is one inside a
#     `/*` block a line of code opened. That is the same full-line rule the
#     sibling guards use, and on the C-family surface it is what makes the
#     block reader safe without a string-literal tokenizer: only a line whose
#     own first characters are `//` or `/*` is read as a comment, and inside a
#     single-line string literal the opening quote sits ahead of them. See
#     FAIL-CLOSED for the shapes that reach those first characters anyway.
#   - Everything the shared library lists under its own FAIL-OPEN heading, since
#     a line it classifies as bats fixture data is skipped here too.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED, so each costs a correct edit and never a missed defect:
#   - A determiner that is grammatically definite but whose noun phrase is
#     generic ("all three cases the parser admits"), where the enumeration is
#     immediate and the number is not really a claim about the tree. The
#     remedy the rule prescribes -- name the shape, drop the cardinality -- is
#     available and cheap, so this is not worth a second discrimination.
#   - A cardinal quoted inside a comment as a counter-example, outside `*.bats`
#     where the pragma is honored. This file's own header is written to avoid
#     the shape rather than to waive it, which is the demonstration that the
#     remedy is always reachable.
#   - A continuation line whose own first characters are `//` or `/*` (or `{/*`,
#     since the container strip runs first), inside a construct that spans
#     lines: a multi-line template literal, a backslash-continued ordinary
#     string literal, or a JSX text node. The owns-its-line rule reads such a
#     line as a comment. Inside either literal form the quote that opened it is
#     on an earlier line and nothing one line wide can see it; a JSX text node
#     is not a literal at all, so no quote was ever ahead of those characters.
#     Reaching any of them needs the string tokenizer that rule exists to
#     avoid, so they are recorded rather than chased.
#
#     Be precise about the cost, because the obvious bound is wrong. The `/*`
#     spelling is not confined to the literal: it raises the block state, and
#     nothing lowers that until a line carrying `*/`, which inside a literal
#     there is no reason to expect. Every line to the end of the file is then
#     handed to the predicate as prose, ordinary executable code included, so a
#     phrase matching the class anywhere below reds on a line that is not a
#     comment at all. The `//` spelling costs one line, which is the bound that
#     does hold. Both directions fail closed, and both are visible: the report
#     names a file and a line, and a reader looking at code rather than a
#     comment has the answer in front of them. The suite pins this direction
#     deliberately, so the disclosure is enforced rather than asserted.

    # Only the first non-space characters of the line can open a block, which is
    # what keeps a `/*` inside a single-line string literal from opening one:
    # the quote that started the literal sits ahead of it on the same line. The
    # header records the shapes that reach those first characters anyway.
    #
    # One optional `{` is stripped ahead of those tests, which is what reaches
    # the JSX comment container `{/* ... */}`. That form is the ordinary way to
    # comment inside a render body, so a `.tsx` surface read without it is read
    # in name only. Stripping it costs nothing the paragraph above relies on: a
    # `{` cannot open a string literal, so a line whose first characters are
    # `{/*` is still not inside one, and the owns-its-line property survives.
    # The brace is matched as a bracket expression rather than as an escape,
    # because a bracket expression is literal in every awk flavor while `\{`
    # rests on each one agreeing about an escape POSIX leaves undefined.
    #
    # A JSDoc leader (` * `) needs no stripping HERE. The tokenizer treats `*`
    # as punctuation, and punctuation that is not a clause ender ends a token
    # without ending a clause, so the leader is invisible to the predicate. The
    # `}` closing a JSX container is invisible for the same reason. That
    # reasoning belongs to the predicate alone and does not reach is_pragma
    # below, which compares a whole word instead of tokenizing and so strips the
    # leader itself.
