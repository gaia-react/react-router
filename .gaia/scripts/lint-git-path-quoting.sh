# Why: under git's default `core.quotePath`, a path-listing command C-quotes any
# path carrying a non-ASCII byte, a control character, a double quote or a
# backslash -- it prints `"caf\303\251.txt"`, not `café.txt`. Every consumer
# that then matches the output against a path pattern silently stops matching,
# and in this repository every such consumer fails OPEN: a gate that decides
# "no relevant files changed", or that discovers the files it is about to scan,
# reports its required check green having run nothing. `-z` turns the quoting
# off and NUL-delimits instead.
#
# The class is why this gate exists rather than a review habit. It has been
# found and fixed by hand SEVEN times, every time by a human or an audit member
# reading the code and never once by a check (`#1032`, `#1115`, `#1213`,
# `#1224`, `#1225`, `#1228`, `#1230`). `#1229` is the issue that stopped paying
# that tax for `diff --name-only`, and `#1389` is the one that stopped paying it
# for `ls-files` -- a variant the guard's first shape could not see, which is how
# the class recurred in five discovery call sites INCLUDING this file's own.
#
# Fix a `diff --name-only` hit with the idiom the repository already uses
# throughout:
#
#   changed="$(git diff --name-only -z "${base}...HEAD" | tr '\0' '\n')"
#
# In a workflow `run:` block under `set -eu`, put the pipeline in a subshell
# that sets pipefail, so a git failure still aborts the step as it did before
# the pipe existed -- `$(...)` alone discards NUL bytes, so the `tr` cannot be
# moved out of the substitution:
#
#   changed=$(set -o pipefail; git diff --name-only -z "$B...HEAD" | tr '\0' '\n')
#
# Fix an `ls-files` hit by reading the NUL stream directly, which keeps every
# byte of the path intact rather than round-tripping it through newlines:
#
#   while IFS= read -r -d '' f; do
#     scan_files+=("$f")
#   done < <(git -c core.quotepath=false ls-files -z <pathspecs>)
#
# `-z` alone is what disables the quoting; `-c core.quotepath=false` is
# belt-and-braces for the reader. A `| LC_ALL=C sort` on such a stream must
# become `| LC_ALL=C sort -z`, or the sort re-joins the records on newlines and
# undoes the fix. Both BSD sort (macOS) and GNU sort accept `-z`.
#
# A consumer that COUNTS rather than iterates takes `| tr -cd '\0' | wc -c`,
# never the `| tr '\0' '\n' | wc -l` round-trip above. Translating the records
# back to newlines makes a path holding a literal newline count twice, so on a
# counting consumer the repair advertised for an iterating one REGRESSES the
# site it was applied to: the pre-repair quoted spelling counted correctly,
# because quoting never splits a record. `-z` fixes the byte fidelity; only
# counting the separators themselves fixes the arithmetic.
#
# Reference fixes: .gaia/scripts/resolve-audit-members.sh (the `changed`
# derivation) and .gaia/tests/shell-lint.sh (its discovery loops).
#
# Two `ls-files` shapes are deliberately NOT flagged, and each is a closed
# property of the call text rather than a judgment about its consumer:
#
#   --error-unmatch  -- the call is an existence assertion whose contract is its
#                       exit status, not its output; git's own documentation
#                       defines the flag that way. Every such call in this tree
#                       discards stdout. Demanding `-z` there would be a change
#                       with no failure mode behind it.
#   an option-less   -- `-z` is accepted anywhere in the call's OPTION region,
#   -z position         which ends at the first token not starting with `-` or
#                       at an explicit `--`. `ls-files` idiomatically carries
#                       selector options first (`--others --exclude-standard
#                       -z`), and `diff` carries `--cached` or `--staged` ahead
#                       of `--name-only`, so both halves read the region rather
#                       than a fixed position. Terminating the walk at the first
#                       non-option is what stops a pathspec carrying the token
#                       from vouching for a call that still quotes.
#
# `git status --porcelain` is the third member of this family and is deliberately
# OUT of the declared surface rather than merely unreached. Its dominant shape in
# this repository is an emptiness test (`[ -z "$(git status --porcelain)" ]`),
# where quoting cannot change the verdict, and its remaining instances sit in
# adopter-facing workflow templates that regenerate through `bundle:adopter`.
# Claiming it here would red the gate on call sites that carry no failure mode,
# which is how a gate gets bypassed rather than fixed.
#
# A fenced code block on a tracked markdown page IS on the declared surface, and
# the reason is that several of them are executed instruction rather than
# illustration: an always-loaded rule tells the agent to run that page's steps as
# written, so the snippet is a live call site. Three carried this class at once,
# in the quality gate's own skip check, in the wiki-sync added-page count feeding
# the consolidate trigger, and in the health runbook's staging-tree discovery,
# and no check could see any of them.
#
# The discriminator is FENCE STATE, never a path glob enumerating which pages are
# executed. A glob is an enumeration, and an enumeration goes one page short the
# same way a list of option spellings does; fence state is a closed property of
# the text. An illustrative mention of a path-listing command is idiomatically a
# code span, which the `inspan` rule below already treats as prose, so the two
# rules partition markdown between them: outside a fence nothing is scanned at
# all, and inside one nothing is prose. Swept across every tracked markdown page
# in this repository, that partition reported the live defects and nothing else,
# which is what makes the rule affordable as well as closed.
#
# What the fence rule reads is stated in the scanner beside the code that does
# it: a closer matches the opener's character and length, and a leading `>` is
# part of the delimiter's run. Its remaining blind spots:
#   - An illustrative fenced block that DELIBERATELY shows an unquoted call as a
#     counter-example is flagged. That is FAIL-CLOSED, and the repair is to write
#     the counter-example as a code span or to let it carry `-z`.
#   - A page whose fences do not balance inverts the polarity from the unclosed
#     delimiter onward. FAIL-OPEN past that point, and unlike the nesting case
#     a parity count over the page does detect it, because the page really is
#     unbalanced and renders wrong for its human reader too.
#   - An indented code block, the four-space form carrying no delimiter at all,
#     is never entered and so is never scanned. FAIL-OPEN. Nothing distinguishes
#     it from an indented continuation line without parsing the block structure
#     the delimiters make free, and no page in this tree executes one.
#
# So: the surface this file claims is at zero for `ls-files` and for every
# option spelling of `diff --name-only`, which is what the tests below pin. The
# `diff` half reads its option region rather than a fixed string, so an OPTION
# written between `diff` and `--name-only` -- `--cached`, `--staged`, or any
# other -- no longer hides the call. A positional REVISION in that position
# still does, and that limit is stated with the other blind spots below rather
# than left to be read out of this sentence.
#
# The sibling plumbing commands come along with that, and the reason is worth
# stating so a maintainer who meets the red does not read it as a misfire. The
# matched text is now the bare `diff`, so every `diff-*` plumbing spelling is
# reached on one mechanism: the tail (`-index`, `-tree`, `-files`) is dash-led,
# so the walk continues past it into the real options and finds `--name-only`
# there. The set is stated by that shared property rather than enumerated,
# because an enumeration of it goes one command short the same way a list of
# option spellings does. The demand is CORRECT on all of them: each quotes a
# path exactly as `git diff` does. None is invoked in this tree today, so this
# is reach the widening brought rather than coverage anyone asked for, and it
# is left in place because narrowing the match to exclude them would trade a
# fail-closed demand that is right for a blind spot that is not.
#
# Sibling gate: .gaia/scripts/check-audit-base-derivation.sh's assertion 4 makes
# the same claim about the audit agents' prose. This file is deliberately not
# folded into it: that check's remit is the audit-base derivation, and its
# `consumes` predicate keys on the audit-base variable spellings and the
# resolver name, none of which any shell call site here mentions.

#
# Four discriminations, each earning its place on a real line in this
# repository rather than on symmetry:
#
#   invoked  -- the text immediately before the call is a `git` invocation,
#               optionally carrying -C/-c options. Without it,
#               check-audit-base-derivation.sh's GAIA_AUDIT_DIFF_CALL is a hit:
#               the call is that variable's VALUE, not a command.
#   in-fence -- markdown only, and the whole of what makes a documentation page
#               scannable without making it noisy: a line is a candidate when a
#               fence delimiter has opened and none has closed it. Every other
#               line on the page is prose and is never read.
#   in-span  -- an odd number of backticks before the call on the line means it
#               sits inside a markdown code span, so it is prose. Without it,
#               the audit workflow's agent prompt is a hit, where a code span
#               instructs a model to run the command. It is switched off inside
#               a fence, where a code span cannot nest and an odd count is a
#               legacy substitution instead.
#   in-option-region
#            -- both halves accept `-z` as a standalone token anywhere in the
#               call's option region, and stop at the first token not beginning
#               with `-`, or at an explicit `--`. A fixed position would be
#               wrong for either: `ls-files` idiomatically carries selectors
#               first (`--others --exclude-standard -z`), and `diff` carries
#               `--cached` or `--staged` before `--name-only`. Terminating the
#               walk is what keeps the guarantee a fixed position was there to
#               give: a pathspec cannot vouch for the call, because the walk
#               never reaches one. `diff` is on the surface only when the walk
#               finds `--name-only` in that region, so a plain `git diff` and a
#               `git diff --quiet` are never candidates.
#
# Full-line comments are skipped outright, which covers both a shell comment and
# a `#` line inside a workflow `run:` block.
#
# Known blind spots, stated rather than discovered later, and split by which
# WAY they fail, because that is the part that matters: they are not all
# fail-closed, and treating them alike hides the ones that are not.
#
# The backtick boundary is stated as a RULE rather than as a list of shapes,
# deliberately. An enumeration of shapes is always one shape short, and each
# round of extending it invites the next; the rule below is closed, so it cannot
# be incomplete:
#
#   The command-position test recognizes a backtick opening immediately after
#   `=` or `(`, and NOTHING ELSE. Every other position is treated as a markdown
#   code span.
#
# Both of that rule's error directions follow from it and neither is a separate
# discovery:
#   - FAIL-OPEN: a backtick command substitution opening after anything else --
#     a quote, a pipe, a separator, or bare command position -- is missed. That
#     is a real miss, and closing it needs a shell tokenizer, which is more
#     machinery than this gate is worth.
#   - FAIL-CLOSED: parenthetical prose whose parenthesis is followed by a
#     backtick is flagged as an invocation. The repair is to reword the prose.
#
# The other boundaries, both FALSE POSITIVES, so both fail CLOSED. They demand
# `-z`, which is never wrong on a call whose output is parsed, so each costs a
# correct edit and never a missed defect:
#   - `-z` written on a line continuation after the call reads as missing. This
#     is not a `*.bats` question and it does not change with the widened
#     surface.
#   - A single-quoted string containing a literal `git diff --name-only` reads
#     as an invocation on `*.sh`, husky, workflow YAML and markdown, where
#     nothing distinguishes a string constant from executed shell. On `*.bats`
#     the same text, written through a recognized fixture-writing idiom, is
#     read as data instead; see
#     wiki/decisions/Shell Guard Fixture Discrimination.md for the convention.
#
# `*.bats` residuals, now that the surface reaches it:
#   - A fixture written through a helper outside guard-awk-lib.sh's recognized
#     set is read as executed shell rather than data, so it reds until the set
#     is extended or the line carries a suppression pragma.
#   - The suppression pragma is itself a residual on every OTHER surface: a
#     `gaia-lint-ignore lint-git-path-quoting: ...` comment above a line in a
#     `*.sh`, husky, workflow-YAML or markdown file waives nothing there. This
#     guard is the designated reader for the pragma, and reports that shape as
#     honored nowhere outside `*.bats` rather than treating it as a fix.
#
# Two further FALSE NEGATIVES, unrelated to backticks:
#   - A call assembled through a variable (`$GIT diff --name-only`), which is
#     equally tokenizer-bound.
#   - `--name-only` written AFTER a positional revision (`git diff HEAD
#     --name-only`, `git diff "$base...HEAD" --name-only`). The walk terminates
#     at the revision, because a revision is exactly what a non-option token
#     looks like, so the option region never reaches the flag and the call is
#     classified off-surface. This is a fail-OPEN miss of the gate's own class,
#     and it is the price of the termination rule: the same stop is what keeps
#     a pathspec from vouching for a call that quotes. Distinguishing a revision
#     from a pathspec needs git's own argument parser, not a scanner. Every call
#     in this tree writes its options first, which is the idiom the fix hints
#     advertise, so nothing here is missed today.
#
# Out of scope entirely: `-z` does not, on its own, survive a path containing a
# literal newline when the consumer re-splits on newlines via `tr`. That is a
# separate and far rarer class than the one this gate closes, and nothing here
# asserts otherwise.
