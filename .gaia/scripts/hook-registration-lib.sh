# blocking hook filed under an Advisory wiki heading) and

# fails open). A second copy of either question drifts from the first silently,
# because each gate's own suite passes against its own copy.
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible. Never `cd`.

# Succeed when the script can stop a tool call: it emits a permissionDecision,
# or it exits 2. Full-line comments are excluded, which is load-bearing rather
# than tidy -- at least one advisory hook here carries the string `exit 2` in a
# paragraph of its header explaining a failure mode it does NOT cause, and
# grading that as a block would misfile a correctly-filed advisory hook.
#
# ONE awk PASS, not a `grep -v | grep -q` pipeline, and the reason is a fail-open
# the first consumer was caught by on its first run against the live tree.
# `grep -q` exits at its first match and closes the pipe under it; the upstream
# grep then takes SIGPIPE and returns 141, and `set -o pipefail` promotes that to
# the pipeline's status. The function returned non-zero ON A MATCH, so every hook
# whose upstream lost that race classified as advisory and the check reported
# clean over the very defect it was written for. A single process cannot lose
# that race.
#
# The `exit 2` test pads the line on both sides so the surrounding-character
# class needs no anchor alternation: with a leading and trailing space, a bare
# `exit 2` matches and `exit 22` cannot.
#
# The comment exclusion reads text rather than control flow, so an `exit 2`
# inside a heredoc or a string over-classifies. That direction is the safe one
# for both consumers: over-classifying can only red a hook a human then reads,
# while under-classifying returns a silent wrong answer about whether an action
# stops.
