# lint-hook-cwd-relative-loads.sh: flag every place a hook under
# `.claude/hooks/**` locates FRAMEWORK CODE by a bare repository-root-relative
# path, which resolves against the process working directory rather than
# against the hook's own checkout. It roots itself at its own on-disk location,
# so it can be run from anywhere:
# `bash .gaia/scripts/lint-hook-cwd-relative-loads.sh`.
#
# Exit 0 when clean, and 1 either with a file:line report on any hit or on a
# scan surface that came back empty or short. Exit 2 says the gate never ran:
# git is unavailable, its own root is unresolvable, the discovery command
# failed, or awk could not read a file in the surface.

# Enforced by the sibling bats suite
# .gaia/scripts/tests/lint-hook-cwd-relative-loads.bats, which the `Audit CI
# Tests` scripts shard runs, and folded into .gaia/tests/shell-lint.sh so every

# `bats .gaia/scripts/tests/lint-hook-cwd-relative-loads.bats`.
# gaia:maintainer-only:end
#
# Why: a hook is registered in .claude/settings.json by an absolute path, so it
# runs with the working directory of whatever tool call triggered it, which is
# the agent's session cwd and persists for the whole session. A load written as
#
#     [ -f .claude/hooks/lib/red-ledger.sh ] && . .claude/hooks/lib/red-ledger.sh
#     type red_ledger_path >/dev/null 2>&1 || exit 0
#
# is therefore false from any directory below the repository root, and the
# capability probe behind it stands the hook down. That `exit 0` is a deliberate
# fail-open written for a BROKEN or ABSENT library, and it is correct for that
# case; a cwd-relative load is what makes a MOVED WORKING DIRECTORY
# indistinguishable from a missing file, so a single `cd` buys the fail-open.
# Two of the hooks carrying the shape are blocking guards (the RED-before-GREEN
# commit gate and the worthiness merge gate), and neither emits a diagnostic
# when it stands down, so the disarm is indistinguishable from a clean pass.
#
# The repair, which the tree already used correctly in several places before
# this gate existed, roots the path at the hook's own on-disk location:
#
#     _lib_dir="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/lib" 2>/dev/null && pwd)" || _lib_dir=''
#     [ -n "$_lib_dir" ] && [ -f "$_lib_dir/red-ledger.sh" ] && . "$_lib_dir/red-ledger.sh"
#
# `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` is the path the registration invoked, so it names the
# ACTING tree: a worktree session loads that worktree's libraries, and the main
# checkout loads its own. `$PWD` and a bare relative path do not have that
# property, and neither does `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, which holds the session's
# original project directory and does not follow entry into a linked worktree.
#
# Scope: tracked `*.sh` under `.claude/hooks/**`, the surface whose files are
# invoked by absolute path from a working directory nobody controls. It scans
# no other directory, so it needs neither the shared scan-surface library nor
# its bats-fixture discriminator. A path this gate reports is repo-relative
# because the discovery is `git ls-files` scoped to this gate's own root.
#
# Both the quoted and the unquoted spelling of each position are read. The
# distinction that decides a hit is literal-versus-variable-rooted, never
# quoted-versus-unquoted: `[ -f ".claude/hooks/lib/x.sh" ]` is the same defect
# as its bare spelling, while `[ -f "$_lib_dir/x.sh" ]` is the repair.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS A HIT, four positions, each one a place a bare literal is
# resolved against the working directory at run time:
#
#   [ -f .claude/hooks/lib/x.sh ]        a file-test primary's operand
#   . .gaia/scripts/x.sh                 a `.` or `source` operand
#   bash .gaia/scripts/x.sh              an interpreter's script argument
#   lib=".gaia/scripts/x.mjs"            an assignment naming a code file
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT A HIT, and why each exclusion is the right call
# rather than a gap this gate wishes it could close:
#
#   - A per-tree STATE path (`marker=".claude/wiki-drift-checked"`,
#     `config=".gaia/automation.json"`). Those name mutable state rather than
#     code, and `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` is the WRONG root for them: which tree a
#     hook's state belongs to is declared per hook in .gaia/hook-scopes.json,
#     so rooting one at the script's directory would make a `main-only` marker
#     follow a linked worktree. They are cwd-sensitive too, and the repair
#     needs each site read against its declared scope; the assignment arm is
#     pinned to a code extension for exactly that reason.
#   - A git PATHSPEC or revision path (`git rev-parse "HEAD:$p"`). That syntax
#     is resolved by git against the repository root, never against cwd, so a
#     bare literal there is already correct and rewriting it would be churn.
#   - An interpreter argument on a line that `cd`s first
#     (`cd "$root" && bash .gaia/scripts/x.sh`). The `cd` is the rooting, and
#     it is the shape a caller uses when the target tree is deliberately not
#     this hook's own.
#
# KNOWN BLIND SPOTS, split by which way each one fails, because that is the
# part that matters.
#
# FAIL-OPEN, each a construct the line-oriented scan cannot read:
#   - A path reached through a variable the scan cannot follow
#     (`p=".gaia/cli/gaia-maintainer"` then `[ -x "$p" ]`). The assignment arm
#     catches this only where the literal carries a code extension, so an
#     extensionless binary or a data file passes. Both live instances of that
#     shape were repaired by hand when this gate landed.
#   - The same indirection where the variable is not assigned a literal at all
#     but computed per iteration, which no assignment arm can reach: a
#     repo-relative path derived from a diff listing and then tested
#     (`rel=$(... "$path"); [ -f "$rel" ]`) resolves against the working
#     directory exactly like a literal would. This is the shape that survived
#     the first pass of the conversion this gate shipped with, in the
#     worthiness gate, where the failing test read as "the file was deleted"
#     and emptied the scan into a clean pass. Reaching it needs data-flow
#     analysis rather than a line scan, so it stays a blind spot named here;
#     the runtime arms in .gaia/tests/hooks/ that drive each blocking hook from
#     a subdirectory are what cover it, and they are the reason it was found.
#   - A path assembled by expansion (`"$dir/${name}.sh"`), which is
#     tokenizer-bound the same way every sibling gate says of its own class.
#   - A load inside a heredoc body that a `bash -c` later executes. Heredoc
#     bodies are skipped outright, because the tree carries the class in them
#     only as documentation an operator reads.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED, so each costs a correct edit and never a missed defect:
#   - A trailing comment that mentions one of the four positions after real
#     code on the same line. The scan reads the line, not the comment boundary,
#     so the mention reports. No such line exists in this tree.
#
# Provenance: the class was repaired across the hook family in
# gaia-react/gaia#1854, which found it standing behind
# .claude/rules/shell-cwd.md's `cd` prohibition as that rule's real, previously
# unwritten justification. Until this gate existed, that prose rule was the
# only thing holding the class down.
