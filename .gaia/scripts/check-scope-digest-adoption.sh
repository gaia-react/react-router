# Adoption check for SPEC-077's scope-digest staleness gate. The shared
# clearance writer's `--scope-digest` refusal only closes the loop when the
# omission is caught before a member spends a full review round, not after
# it calls the writer and gets refused. Nothing stops a sixth agent
# definition, or an edit to any definition that ships today, from dropping
# `--scope-digest` again once it lands everywhere. This check makes four
# things machine-detectable:
#
#   1. Every earned clearance-write call site, across every agent
#      definition and every workflow copy, passes `--scope-digest`.
#   2. The frozen scope-resolution obligation literal is present, exactly
#      once, byte-identical, in every agent definition.
#   3. The capture command sits inside each definition's own
#      scope-resolution region, not merely mentioned somewhere later in the
#      file -- code-audit-frontend.md names `audit-scope-digest.sh` in
#      several places outside that region, so a whole-file grep would still
#      pass on a definition whose capture had been deleted from the fence
#      and survived only as a stray mention elsewhere.
#   4. Every pre-approval granted for these two scripts actually covers a
#      call site that is spelled the way the grant is spelled. A permission
#      rule is a literal prefix match, so a grant and an invocation can
#      agree in meaning and still miss each other completely, and nothing
#      reports the miss: the call falls through to a prompt exactly as if
#      no grant had ever been written. Assertion 4 is what stops those two
#      spellings drifting apart silently again.
#
# Scan surface for assertion 1 (and the fourth entry, why it's here):
#   .claude/agents/code-audit-*.md
#   .github/workflows/
#   .gaia/cli/src/automation/templates/workflows/
#   .gaia/cli/templates/workflows/
# The fourth is the bundled artifact byte-derived from the third;
# `.gaia/scripts/tests/audit-guard-structural.bats` already asserts the two
# hash equal, so this check's coverage of it is a cheap belt, not an
# independent judgement about a generated file.
#
# Assertion 1's join, and why two different joins: the agent definitions
# spell an earned call site as a fenced bash block whose lines end in a
# trailing backslash; the workflow copies spell the same call as an inline
# backtick-delimited code span word-wrapped across several physical lines of
# a YAML `prompt: |` block, no backslash in sight. A single pass handles
# both without knowing which file it is looking at: a line opening a triple-
# backtick fence toggles fenced mode, where lines are joined on a trailing
# backslash exactly as a shell continuation would join them; outside a
# fence, a single backtick opens or closes an inline span, and a span still
# open at end-of-line absorbs the line break as one space and keeps
# accumulating on the next line. A line-at-a-time grep cannot see either
# shape reliably, since neither the script name nor `--provenance earned`
# nor `--scope-digest` line up on one physical line often enough to be
# found together without the join.
#
# Honest limit: this is a token-and-shape check over prose, not a proof that
# a member run actually captures or reads anything. It proves a definition
# *says* it captures where scope is resolved and passes the flag on every
# earned write it spells out; a member could still say one thing and do
# another at runtime, which nothing here observes.
#
# Dual-mode, mirroring check-verb-arming-adoption.sh: source it for
# gaia_check_scope_digest_adoption, or run it directly as a script.
#
# gaia_check_scope_digest_adoption <repo_root>
#   Prints one line per finding plus a verdict line per assertion. Returns 0
#   when all four hold, 1 when any does not, 2 on the check's own failure.
#   The 2 cases: an unresolvable root, a repo_root with no `.claude/agents/`
#   directory at all (nothing to scan, not a vacuous pass), and assertion
#   4's `jq` being absent. The last of those is reported as 2 only when
#   assertions 1-3 found nothing; when one of them did, the run exits 1 and
#   names it, so an environment note never hides those findings behind a
#   status that reads as "fix your toolchain and re-run".
#
#   What a missing `jq` still costs, and it is not hidden: assertion 4
#   returns at its own settings arm, so its WORKFLOW half does not run
#   either, even though that half needs no `jq`. A grant-versus-call-site
#   drift inside a workflow file is therefore neither found nor named on a
#   `jq`-less machine. Nothing merges on it -- exit 2 is non-zero and
#   `.gaia/tests/whole-tree-invariants.sh` fails on any non-zero -- so this
#   is a coverage gap behind a blocking status, not a fail-open.
#
#   <repo_root> is a required parameter -- this check never derives it
#   itself, so a bats fixture can drive it against a throwaway repo.

# The Code Audit Team members this check reasons about, and assertion 3's
# per-member region anchor beside each. Both are DISCOVERED by
# _gaia_sda_load_members below, never transcribed here. A transcribed roster
# cannot see the one definition this check's own header names as the thing it
# exists to catch: a newly registered member whose earned call sites omit
# `--scope-digest` would never be opened, every pre-merge check would pass,
# and the defect would surface mid-round as a forfeited review. Declared
# empty so the loader is the only writer.

#
# Both directions fail, and they fail for different reasons. A grant with no
