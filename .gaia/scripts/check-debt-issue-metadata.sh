# check-debt-issue-metadata.sh: validate the label set and dedup key a tech-debt
# filing carries, against the rules `.claude/skills/file-tech-debt/SKILL.md`
# states. Exit 0 when clean, 1 on any finding, 2 on a usage or environment
# error. Run it from the repository root.
#
# Three modes, two of them offline:
#
#   --pre-file --labels <csv> --body-file <path>
#       The blocking mode. Validates a filing that has NOT happened yet, from
#       the label set about to reach `gh issue create` argv and the body file
#       step 4 of the recipe already builds. Reads no network and needs no
#       `gh`, so the gate in front of every filing is hermetic.
#
#   --issue <N>
#       Advisory. Validates one already-filed issue, read through `gh`.
#
#   --sweep
#       Advisory. Validates every open `tech-debt` issue. This is the mode that
#       answers "what is already wrong", and it relabels nothing: the repair for
#       an existing issue is a human decision per issue, not a sweep.
#
# Why a script and not another paragraph. Every rule enforced below was already
# stated in prose in SKILL.md before this gate existed, and every one of them
# was violated anyway, because prose that nothing reads back is a convention
# rather than a check. The filing routes are models; the label set they emit is
# the one artifact of a filing that no later step re-reads, so a mistake there
# is silent until a drainer trips over it weeks later. This is the read-back.
# gaia:maintainer-only:start
#
# The `surface:` namespace is the one rule here that SKILL.md did not previously
# state. The two labels existed in the tracker and were applied by hand often
# enough to look like a convention, while being documented nowhere and emitted
# by no filing route. Step 6 of the recipe now defines them; this gate is what
# makes that definition checkable.

# The dedup key, matched as the whole line shape rather than a loose substring,

# than as absent. `path` is required to be repo-relative POSIX: a leading slash
# or a backslash means an absolute or Windows path reached the key, and every
# consumer of the key compares it against repo-relative paths.
#
# `path` is a GREEDY `.+`, not `[^ ]+`, and that is load-bearing rather than
# lazy: repository paths legally contain spaces, and this repository has one
# under an existing key (`path=wiki/concepts/PR Merge Workflow.md`). A
# space-intolerant pattern reports every such key as malformed, which on the
# blocking `--pre-file` path would refuse a correct filing outright. The greedy
# form plus the anchored ` line=<int> -->` tail performs the same split
# `.claude/skills/gaia/references/debt.md`'s own capture performs.
#
# CRLF is handled by normalizing the body before it reaches these patterns (see
# `check_body`), never by an escape inside the pattern itself. `\r` in an ERE is
# BSD-only: GNU grep reads a backslash before an ordinary character as that
# character, so `-->\r?$` means "an optional literal r" on Linux. That spelling
# is worse than no tolerance at all, because it inverts by platform. It matches
# a CRLF key on macOS and not on Linux, matches a key ending in a stray literal
# `r` on Linux and not on macOS, and GNU sed accepts `\r` where GNU grep does
# not, so the shape test and the path extraction below would disagree with each
# other on the same body. Normalizing once removes the divergence instead of
# relocating it.
