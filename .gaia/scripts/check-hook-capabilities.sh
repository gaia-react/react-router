# check-hook-capabilities.sh -- reconcile what every REGISTERED hook is
# DECLARED to do against what the tree actually lets it do.
#
# A `hooks` registration in .claude/settings.json is a standing, prompt-free
# grant of a different shape than a `permissions.allow` entry:
# .gaia/scripts/check-script-capabilities.sh closes the allowlisted-script
# axis, this closes the registered-hook one. The registered surface is
# arguably the sharper of the two, because a hook needs no invocation at all
# -- an allowlisted script runs when an agent decides to call it, a
# registered hook runs because Claude Code fired a trigger event, with no
# prompt and no line in any transcript that names it.
# .gaia/hook-capabilities.json declares each registered hook's real scope;
# this check holds the declaration to the code in BOTH directions --
# undeclared reach and declared-but-unreached are each a finding, so a
# blanket declaration fails on its first run. `invokes:` is the one
# exemption from the second direction: a declared target counts as reached
# by definition, so that a declaration clearing an unresolvable call never
# turns into a surplus.
#
# What this buys is detection at review time, not prevention. Nothing here
# mediates a registered hook at run time: a local session runs a widened
# hook before any CI run sees it, and the manifest itself is editable under
# a standing Edit grant. The value is that a widening becomes visible and
# has to be argued for, not that it becomes impossible.
#
# Reach is TRANSITIVE, walked by the same shared closure the allowlisted-
# script check uses: every file a hook invokes, sourced or executed,
# contributes its own reach to the caller, recursively, whether or not the
# target is itself a registered hook.
#
# Dual-mode, mirroring the repo's other check scripts: source it for the
# functions below, or run it directly.
#
#   bash .gaia/scripts/check-hook-capabilities.sh [<repo_root>]
#   bash .gaia/scripts/check-hook-capabilities.sh [<repo_root>] --print-reach [<hook>]
#
# <repo_root> defaults to `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and is the injection
# point every test drives the check through; an argument beginning with `-` is
# never the positional. `--print-reach` is a diagnostic, not a gate: it needs
# no manifest on disk and always exits 0.
#
# Exit 0 clean, 1 on at least one finding, 2 on the check's own failure.

# Needs bash 5. On stock macOS /bin/bash (3.2) the closure walk loses whole
# files' records, so a clean tree reports fabricated SURPLUS and, in the

# gaia_hookcap_obligated <repo_root>
#   Prints one obligated hook path per recognized `hooks` registration
#   command, deduped, and a BAD-REGISTRATION line per registration in a form
#   the predicate cannot reduce to a repo-relative `.sh` path. Obligation is
#   per PATH, not per registration: the same hook registered at several
#   events carries one obligation, which is why the raw stream is deduped
#   before classification rather than after.
#
#   This deliberately diverges from the allowlisted-script check, which skips
#   a grant carrying no `.sh` token silently -- right there, because most
#   grants are not scripts at all. Wrong here: every `hooks` command is
#   something Claude Code executes automatically with no prompt, so the
#   moment one of them is unobligated the always-boundary this check exists
#   to hold has already failed.

  # A bare repo-relative .sh path: no leading /, ~ or $, no whitespace, no
  # pipe. This is what rejects the four unrecognized forms whole: a
  # $HOME-prefixed path and a ${VAR}-interpolated path both start with `$`
  # rather than the allowed leading class; a `bash -c` wrapper and a piped
  # `.sh` path both carry a space or a `|` before the terminal `.sh`.
  local bare='^[A-Za-z0-9_.][^[:space:]|]*\.sh$'
  # A registration rooted at a command substitution reduces to the bare path
  # inside it: `"$(<root-expr>)/.claude/hooks/x.sh"` names the same one file the
  # bare form did. .claude/settings.json roots every hook this way so that a
  # command resolves independently of the shell's working directory;
  # .gaia/scripts/check-hook-command-rooting.sh owns that shape and holds the
  # file to it.
  #
  # This recognizes the SHAPE, not one spelling, so neither script has to carry
  # a copy of the other's literal. It loosens nothing the paragraph above
  # rejects: a $HOME-prefixed path, a ${VAR}-interpolated one, a `bash -c`
  # wrapper and a piped path are all still unrecognized, because none of them is
  # a command substitution, and whatever survives the strip must still satisfy
  # `bare` on its own.
  #
  # The residual, stated rather than implied: a substitution's value is not
  # knowable without running it, so a rooted registration is trusted to name the
  # repository root. That is what the rooting check is for, and it is why this
  # accepts the form rather than evaluating it.
  local rooted='^"\$\((.*)\)/(.*)"$'
  # Both groups above are greedy, so a command carrying more than one
  # substitution still matches: the first group runs to the LAST `)/` and the
  # second keeps only the final path. That command names more than one script
  # and the strip can hand back only one, so the reduction is not a reduction
  # at all -- it is a guess that drops every earlier path out of the obligated
  # set, and drops it silently, because what survives is a well-formed bare
  # path that clears the arm below. Recognize the rooted shape only where the
  # command carries a single substitution; anything else stays whole and
  # reaches BAD-REGISTRATION as itself.
  #
  # The why-not, since obligating every path the command names is the other
  # available answer: doing that would make this check the de facto
  # specification for a registration spelling, since it would accept, and
  # derive obligations from, a shape no prose surface describes. The check
  # enforces .claude/rules/maintainers/hook-registration.md rather than
  # extending it, and that page already answers a command the anchored pattern
  # cannot reduce by rewriting the registration.
  #
  # A reader comparing this against .gaia/scripts/hook-registration-lib.sh will
  # find it yields BOTH paths on such a command, and that is not this refusal
  # contradicted. That library answers which hooks are registered, for the
  # gates that classify them, and it reads one event key where this walks them
  # all; it is not a drop-in for the reduction here and refusing a shape is not
  # a claim about how a different question should be answered.

# gaia_hookcap_local_registrations <repo_root>
#   LOCAL-REGISTRATION, the plan-authored arm for resolved deferral 5. A
#   .claude/settings.local.json `hooks` command the committed
#   .claude/settings.json does not carry. Absent local settings is the
#   common adopter/CI case and stays silent: no finding, no diagnostic, no
#   non-zero exit. Not waivable, and it participates in no other
#   reconciliation direction -- a local registration creates no manifest
#   obligation, because the manifest is a committed artifact and the local
#   file is not.
#
#   The deregistration case, an edit removing a hook's registration and its
#   manifest entry together, is deliberately out of scope: catching it needs
#   git history, which would make the check stateful and its verdict depend
#   on the base ref.
#
#   What this arm actually buys: the local file is gitignored, so it is
#   absent on every CI runner and this arm is silent there by its own
#   contract. It is not a gated control. It surfaces a finding only on a
#   maintainer's own run, the one context where the file exists.
