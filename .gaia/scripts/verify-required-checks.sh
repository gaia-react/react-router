# verify-required-checks.sh: detect drift between the checks this repo
# deliberately requires to merge and the live GitHub ruleset's
# required_status_checks list (#807). The ruleset lives GitHub-side and can
# drift silently: a check can report red without blocking a merge if it was
# never added to the ruleset, or can quietly stop blocking if removed from
# it. This script makes that drift visible; it never writes to the live
# ruleset -- registering a required check stays a deliberate, maintainer-run
# step, the same ask-first cutover read-audit-ci-config.sh documents for
# GAIA-Audit.
#
# Usage:
#   verify-required-checks.sh [--repo <owner/name>] [--branch <branch>]
#                              [--ruleset-contexts <file-or-->]
#                              [--workflows-dir <dir>]
#
#   --repo               defaults to `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner`.
#   --branch             defaults to the remote HEAD branch, else `main`.
#   --ruleset-contexts   test injection: read live-required contexts from
#                        this file (one context per line) instead of
#                        calling `gh api`. `-` reads stdin.
#   --workflows-dir      defaults to `.github/workflows`; test injection
#                        point for a fixture directory.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every declared-required context is confirmed in the live ruleset.
#   1  at least one declared-required context is missing from the live
#      ruleset, the exact drift class #807 exists to catch.
#   2  usage error, or the live ruleset could not be read (gh api failed).
#
# DO NOT add `set -e` (matches audit-noop-detect.sh): the missing/advisory
# loops below rely on grep/comparison exit status without aborting the script.

# The checks this repo has deliberately decided must block a merge. Keep
