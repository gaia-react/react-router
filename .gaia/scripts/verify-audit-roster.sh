# verify-audit-roster.sh: the Code Audit Team roster's deterministic check.
#
# The roster is meant to grow, by adopters and by the maintainer, as a project
# adds languages and surfaces. Its silent failure modes, each made loud here:
#
#   * A forgotten machinery registration. Only files the machinery lists carry
#     land in every member's content digest, so an unlisted agent file rotates
#     no member's key and a change to it merges unaudited by the members it
#     should force.
#   * A glob overlap between two claimant members. Ownership is first-match-wins
#     over roster order, so an overlap hands a path to whichever member the
#     roster happens to list first, and stays invisible until someone adds a
#     file that lands in it.
#   * A member's own definition disagreeing with the roster about what it owns.
#     Claiming less makes a dispatched member self-skip work it was sent to do;
#     claiming more makes a file read as covered while dispatching nobody, so
#     the diff clears the merge gate having been reviewed by no one.
#
# Reads live state, never writes: no API write, no file write, no git mutation.
# One finding block per violation on stdout; exit 1 if any fired. `--emit-roster`
# is a read-only output mode the remit writer (write-audit-remits.sh) consumes
# to obtain the roster's raw globs.
#
# The invariants:
#
#   1. Pairwise claimant disjointness, as GLOB LANGUAGES, whether or not any
#      such file is tracked. An overlap names the pair and cites a witness path
#      that matches both globs, synthesized by construction from the two
#      patterns rather than searched for in a file list: the file need not
#      exist, which is the whole point of the invariant.
#   2. The default member is excluded from that comparison entirely. Its tier is
#      reached only after every claimant has failed to match, so an overlap
#      between the default and a claimant is what the precedence tier means, not
#      a defect.
#   3. A glob pair the bounded dialect cannot decide FAILS, naming the pair,
#      rather than passing. The check never fails open on the assertion it
#      exists to make.
#   4. Every roster member has an agent file on disk, registered in BOTH
#      machinery lists; exactly one member carries `default: true`.
#   5. Every roster member's name carries the `code-audit-` prefix. The local
#      self-heal hook (block-selfheal-paths.sh) binds a dispatched member to its
#      repair boundary by that prefix, not a roster lookup, so a member named
#      off-convention escapes the boundary silently. The prefix is already
#      load-bearing in the roster glob, the machinery lists, and the release
#      scrub's leak-check; this asserts it rather than assuming it.
#   6. Remit region parity. Every member's agent definition carries exactly one
#      balanced remit region, and the globs inside it are that member's roster
#      globs, complete and in roster order. A region that is absent, duplicated,
#      unbalanced, or reversed (its end marker appearing before its start
#      marker) fails; so does a roster glob the region omits, a region glob
#      the roster does not grant, and the same set in a different order, because
#      ownership is first-match-wins over roster order and a reordered region is
#      a different reading order. Every glob inside a region is classified by the
#      same bounded dialect as (3), which is why the default member's globs and a
#      lone claimant's are dialect-checked at all: the pairwise comparison in (1)
#      reaches neither position. The region's SENTENCE text is deliberately not
#      compared here; the writer (write-audit-remits.sh) owns the region's exact
#      form, and re-running it is the repair for every finding in this group.
#   7. Coverage: every tracked path resolves an owner, or is declared in the
#      roster's `unowned:` list. The inverse of (1) through (6), which all ask
#      whether the roster's entries are well-formed and none of which asks
#      whether they reach the repository at all. An `unowned:` entry reaching an
#      owned path fails as overbroad, and one no ownerless path needs fails as
#      redundant; together those are what stop the list being a free opt-out. A
#      dead entry fails too, on the maintainer repo only. The section's own
#      docblock below carries the reasoning, including why the universe is the
#      tracked files of the repository ROOTED AT --root and nothing wider.
#
# THE BOUNDED DIALECT, and why intersection is decidable over it at all. The
# classifier compiles three constructs (glob_to_regex, in the roster module
# sourced below):
#
#   literal  -> escaped literal   itself
#   *        -> [^/]*             any run within one segment, never crossing /
#   **       -> .*                anything, including /
#   **/      -> (.*/)?            any depth, INCLUDING zero segments
#
# Over that dialect a glob is a sequence of path segments, where each segment
# either matches exactly one path segment (a pattern of literals and single
# `*`s) or is a whole-segment `**` matching a run of segments: zero or more when
# a segment follows it, one or more when it ends the glob. Two such sequences
# intersect iff a product-automaton walk over segment positions reaches both
# ends, and the walk's own trace spells the witness. That is a bounded
# structural comparison, not general regex intersection.
#
# THE FRAGMENT THIS CHECK DECIDES, stated exactly, because a maintainer who
# teaches the classifier a new construct must teach it here too:
#
#   ACCEPTED: a glob whose `/`-separated segments are each either the whole
#   segment `**`, or a non-empty pattern of literal characters and single `*`s.
#   Every accepted pair is decided; there is no accepted-but-undecided case.
#
#   REJECTED as undecidable, never passed: an empty glob or an empty segment
#   (`a//b`, a leading or trailing `/`); any of ? [ ] { } or \, which a reader may
#   intend as wildcards and which the classifier silently escapes into literals;
#   `**` inside a segment rather than as a whole one (`app/**.ts`), whose
#   compiled form the segment model cannot represent; a run of three or more
#   `*`; whitespace, which the classifier's record contract cannot carry.
#
# Do not extend the dialect here, and do not make this checker cleverer than the
# classifier. The undecidable-pair failure is what makes a dialect drift loud
# instead of silent.
#
# DO NOT add `set -e` (matches verify-required-checks.sh): the loops below rely
# on grep and comparison exit status without aborting the script.
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible (macOS default): no associative arrays, no `mapfile`, no
# `${var^^}`. The script's own working directory never moves: both `cd`s are
# inside command substitutions, so each ends with its subshell -- the source-time
# lib resolution, and the coverage guard's `$(cd … && pwd -P)` pair, whose `-P`
# is what makes that a symlink-normalized comparison rather than a string
# compare. Never `cd` in the script's own shell.

# --- Invariant: every tracked path resolves an owner -------------------------
#
# The inverse of every invariant above. Those ask whether the roster's entries
# are well-formed; this asks whether the roster's entries COVER the repository,
# which is the one question the dispatch resolver structurally cannot answer for
# itself. A path no member's globs match resolves an empty dispatched set, falls
# to the merge gate's legacy branch, is out-of-scope-allowlisted, and merges
# unreviewed -- and that is silent by construction, because an empty member set
# is also the legitimate answer for a genuinely out-of-remit diff. Nothing else
# distinguishes "nothing here needs an owner" from "this needs one and has none".
#
# So the roster declares the difference, in an `unowned:` list beside `auditors:`,
# and this invariant is the ledger over the two together. The list is read only
# here: no dispatch path consults it, so an entry can never suppress a review it
# would otherwise have forced.
#
# WHY AN EXEMPTION LIST IS NOT THE RUBBER STAMP IT LOOKS LIKE, which is the
# objection this design has to answer rather than dodge, since a freely
# appendable opt-out reproduces the current situation with more machinery:
#
#   * Appending is REVIEWED. The list lives in .gaia/audit-ci.yml, a path the
#     roster already grants to a member, so adding an exemption dispatches an
#     auditor. Adding an ownerless file today dispatches nobody. That is the
#     whole asymmetry: the silent move becomes the loud one.
#   * A blanket exemption CANNOT PASS. An entry that reaches a path some member
#     already owns is broader than the ownerless region it exists to describe,
#     and fails as overbroad -- which `**`, the one move that would neuter this
#     invariant in a single line, necessarily does.
#   * The list cannot rot into scenery. An entry no ownerless path needs (every
#     path it covers is covered by another entry too) fails as redundant, so the
#     list cannot grow by accretion.
#
# THE UNIVERSE is the tracked file list of the repository ROOTED AT $root:
# `git ls-files`, so untracked scratch files and ignored build output are not
# the roster's problem. It is deliberately not "$root looks like it is inside a
# checkout": a --root naming a SUBDIRECTORY of a repository would otherwise
# enumerate the enclosing repository and report every path outside the injected
# tree as ownerless, answering a question nobody asked. When $root is not itself
# a repository root the universe is empty and this invariant does not run. That
# is not a fail-open on the real path: with no --root the root is derived from
# `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` above, so a default run is always at a
# repository root, and the injected case is a caller who has explicitly named
# the tree to describe.
#
# Residue, bounded and stated rather than silently carried: the record stream
# below is TAB-separated and newline-delimited, so a tracked path containing
# either character misaligns its fields. The roster's own dialect rejects
# whitespace in a glob for the same reason, and no such path exists here.
