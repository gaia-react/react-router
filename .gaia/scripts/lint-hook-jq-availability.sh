# lint-hook-jq-availability.sh: flag a PreToolUse hook that parses its payload
# with jq and, when jq is absent, fails OPEN. Exit 0 when clean, 1 with a
# per-hook report on any hit, 2 on the check's own failure, and 130 or 143 when
# a SIGINT or SIGTERM interrupts it. Run it from anywhere:
# `bash .gaia/scripts/lint-hook-jq-availability.sh [<repo_root>]`.
# gaia:maintainer-only:start
#
# Enforced by the sibling bats suite
# .gaia/scripts/tests/lint-hook-jq-availability.bats, which the `Audit CI Tests`
# scripts shard runs, and folded into .gaia/tests/shell-lint.sh, whose `**/*.sh`
# and `.claude/settings.json` paths-filter entries between them arm it on both
# surfaces it reads.
# gaia:maintainer-only:end
#
# Why: a hook arms `set -euo pipefail` and reads its payload with jq. On a
# machine with no jq on PATH that read ends the script at status 127 before the
# payload has been looked at, and the PreToolUse contract
# (`wiki/concepts/Claude Hooks.md`) blocks only on exit 2 and treats every other
# non-zero status as a NON-BLOCKING error. The tool call proceeds, with no
# denial and no diagnostic the operator will see, so the whole fail-closed layer
# goes silently inert while the advisory hooks correctly no-op.
#
# The `|| exit 0` spelling is the same defect wearing a guard. A blocking hook
# that stands down on a missing interpreter has decided the call is allowed
# without reading it, which is the outcome the exit-127 path produces by
# accident. So this gate does not ask whether an availability guard EXISTS; it
# asks whether the guard a blocking hook carries can still refuse. A gate keyed
# on the presence of `command -v jq` would report clean over every hook in the
# baseline below.
#
# THE TWO POSTURES, and which hook takes which:
#   blocking  -- the hook can stop a tool call, so it must reach the shared arm
#                (`gaia_require_jq`, .claude/hooks/lib/jq-availability.sh), which
#                refuses with exit 2, narrowed by the caller's own binding
#                literals where its matcher can reach the jq install itself.
#   advisory  -- the hook only ever nudges, so standing down costs a reminder and
#                nothing else. `command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1 || exit 0` is right
#                for it, and refusing would be wrong.
# Which posture a hook has is not this gate's judgement: it reads the same
# blocking oracle .gaia/scripts/lint-hook-advisory-classification.sh reads, out
# of .gaia/scripts/hook-registration-lib.sh, so a hook cannot be blocking for one
# gate and advisory for the other.
#
# SCOPE is the PreToolUse registrations in .claude/settings.json, derived rather
# than listed, so a newly registered hook carries the obligation the moment it is
# registered. It is the right surface rather than `.claude/hooks/*.sh` because
# the fail-open this gate exists for is a PreToolUse semantic: a script under
# that directory which no registration names is invoked directly by a caller who
# sees its exit status, and owes nothing here.
#
# Fail-closed by construction, at each stage guards-must-fail.md names:
#   discovery -- settings.json missing, unparseable, or registering no PreToolUse
#                hook exits 2; a surface where no hook calls jq at all, or where
#                none blocks, exits 2 rather than reporting clean over it
#   arming    -- the posture split comes from the shared oracle, not from a list
#                this gate keeps, so a hook cannot escape by being absent from one
#   match     -- the arm test is a fixed-string search for the shared function's
#                name outside comments, so a hook that only NAMES it in a header
#                paragraph does not satisfy it
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible. Never `cd` (beyond resolving this script's own location).
