#
# Why: POSIX leaves a backslash before an ordinary character UNDEFINED in an
# ERE, and the two grep implementations this repository runs on resolved that
# freedom differently. Measured on macOS `/usr/bin/grep` (BSD grep 2.6.0-FreeBSD)
# against GNU grep on the ubuntu runner:
#
#     \r \n \t \f \a \e   BSD expands to the control character;
#                         GNU matches the bare LETTER.
#     \d \D               BSD expands to the digit / non-digit class;
#                         GNU matches the bare letter.
#
# So one pattern means two different things depending on which machine runs it,
# and the inversion is silent in the direction that matters: a `\r?` written on
# macOS to tolerate CRLF matches a carriage return locally and an optional
# literal `r` in CI, so the check it belongs to quietly stops matching what it
# was written to match and still reports green. That is the shape this gate
# exists for -- invisible to shellcheck, invisible to a suite that runs on the
# authoring platform, and failing toward a pass.
#
# Portable repairs, in the order to reach for them:
#   - a bracket expression, which is POSIX and identical everywhere:
#     `[[:digit:]]`, `[[:space:]]`, `[0-9]`.
#   - a literal control character the SHELL produces, not the regex:
#     `grep -E "carriage$(printf '\r')return"`, or `$'\r'` in bash.
#   - normalize ahead of the match: `tr -d '\r'`, `sed 's/\r$//'`.
#
# The demand is a CLOSED RULE rather than a list of escapes: every backslash
# before a letter is a hit unless the letter is one of `s S w W b B`. An
# enumeration of the divergent escapes is always one escape short, and each
# round of extending it invites the next.
#
# That allowlist is the set both implementations were MEASURED to support with
# the same meaning: `\s`/`\S` whitespace, `\w`/`\W` word character, `\b`/`\B`
# word boundary. They are GNU extensions rather than POSIX, and BSD grep
# implements all six identically, so a pattern using them means one thing on
# both platforms. Roughly ten call sites in this tree use them; demanding a
# rewrite there would cost a flood of edits with no defect behind any of them,
# which is how a gate gets bypassed rather than obeyed.
#
# Everything OUTSIDE that allowlist is flagged, including the letters both
# implementations happen to treat as a bare literal today (`\q`, `\z`, `\p`).
# That is FAIL-CLOSED and deliberate: POSIX leaves them undefined, so today's
# agreement is a coincidence of two implementations rather than a guarantee, and
# the repair is always the same -- drop the backslash -- and never wrong. No
# such escape appears in this tree, so the closed rule costs nothing to hold.
#
# Deliberately NOT claimed: `sed -E`, which carries the identical divergence for
# `\t` and friends. It is a real sibling class and a real gap, left out because
# a sed pattern sits inside an `s///` expression whose delimiter is
# author-chosen, so locating it needs machinery this scan does not have. Stated
# here rather than discovered later.
#
# Scan surface: tracked `*.sh`, the extensionless husky hooks, the workflow and
# composite-action YAML whose `run:` bodies are shell by another name, and the
# adopter workflow templates under
# .gaia/cli/src/automation/templates/workflows/. The templates render into an
# ADOPTER's CI, where the pattern an author wrote and verified on macOS is
# executed by GNU grep on a runner neither this repo's review nor the adopter's
# ever watches; that is this class one distribution hop further out, and it is
# the same reason the sibling run-interpolation gate scans them.
#
# `.gaia/cli/templates/workflows/` is a build artifact copied from `src/` by
# `bundle:adopter` and is deliberately NOT scanned, so no hit is reported twice
# and no report names a file the repair must not hand-edit.
#
# The YAML halves are scanned as RAW LINES rather than by locating `run:` bodies
# structurally, which is the opposite of what the sibling run-interpolation gate
# does, and the asymmetry is the point. That gate's class exists only inside a
# `run:` body, because `${{ }}` is correct everywhere else in a workflow. A
# `grep -E` is a shell call wherever it appears in a workflow file -- in a `run:`
# body, in an agent prompt a step feeds to a model, in a composite action's
# step -- and it carries this class in all of them, so there is nothing for the
# structure to discriminate.
#
# One file type is out of the surface for the reason stated beside it; the
# other now joins it under its own discrimination:
#
#   *.bats  -- tracked bats suites are scanned as their own set, discriminated
#              by the shared `.gaia/scripts/guard-awk-lib.sh`, which tells a
#              fixture literal from an executed call so the suite that
#              demonstrates this class no longer has to be exempt from it. A
#              `gaia-lint-ignore lint-grep-ere-escapes: <reason>` comment above
#              a line waives it there, and nowhere else; an unused one is
#              reported. Residual FAIL-OPENs on this surface, same as the
#              non-bats one below: a fixture written through a helper the
#              shared library's idiom set does not name is skipped rather than
#              reported when it should be the reverse; and every FAIL-OPEN
#              already listed above (a pattern held in a variable, a
#              continued pattern, `\t` in a double-quoted pattern, a wrapper
#              or reassembled grep name, an unbalanced substitution) still
#              applies here unchanged -- none of them is a bats-only gap.
#   *.md    -- the sibling path-quoting gate scans the fenced blocks of tracked
#              markdown because several are executed instruction. The same is
#              true here, but the class needs the pattern to be authored on one
#              platform and RUN on another, and an executed markdown snippet is
#              run by an agent on the author's own machine. The exposure the
#              class needs does not arise, and the fence-state machinery is not
#              free.
#
# `scan_window` and `ere_mode` below are this gate's own retained tokenizer,
# the class detector's window walk rather than the shared library's fixture,
# heredoc, or pragma tracker, and they stay. `scan_window`'s ANSI-C reading
# agrees with the shared library's on the ordinary case, an unescaped `$`
# immediately before a quote opens ANSI-C mode, a `$` inside double quotes
# never does. It does not special-case a backslash-escaped `$` immediately
# before a quote, so unlike the library it reads that shape as ANSI-C too,
# a narrow known gap rather than a claim of full agreement.
#
# The convention behind this file's argument-region discrimination and its
# pragma is recorded once, in wiki/decisions/Shell Guard Fixture Discrimination.md.

#
# FAIL-OPEN, each one a pattern the scan cannot read:
#   - A pattern held in a VARIABLE (`grep -qE "$KEY_RE"`). The escape lives at
#     the assignment, which this scan does not associate with the call. Several
#     call sites in this tree are of that shape.
#   - A pattern continued onto the next line, since the scan is line-oriented.
#   - `\\t` written inside a DOUBLE-quoted pattern. The shell collapses the pair
#     to a single backslash before grep sees it, so grep gets `\t` while the
#     scan reads a portable escaped backslash. Inside single quotes, where the
#     shell passes both bytes through, the reading is correct.
#   - A grep reached through a wrapper name (`zgrep`, `ugrep`) or assembled
#     through a variable (`"$GREP" -E`), neither of which is in command position
#     as this scan recognizes it.
#   - A pattern following a command substitution that contains an unbalanced
#     `)` inside a quoted string of its own. The substitution skip counts
#     parentheses without tracking quotes, so it leaves the region early and the
#     rest of the line is read in the wrong state.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED, so each costs a correct edit and never a missed defect:
#   - Any backslash-escaped letter outside the six-letter allowlist, including
#     the ones both implementations currently treat as a literal.
#
# FALSE POSITIVE, a third direction, and the one worth naming explicitly because
# in each case the demanded edit is not a repair the author can make sense of.
# Neither shape occurs in this tree, which is what the gate running clean over
# it establishes. Each carries its own repair, because they do not share one:
#   - A grep pattern quoted inside ANOTHER tool's program text, as in
#     `awk '/grep -E "a\tb"/ { print }'`. The escape belongs to awk's regex,
#     which has its own portability rules, but the scan sees a `grep` in what
#     looks like command position. Telling the two apart needs a shell
#     tokenizer, which is more machinery than this gate is worth. Hoisting the
#     program into a variable does NOT clear it, because the assignment line
#     still carries the grep token; only moving the escaped letter itself onto a
#     line holding no grep token does.
#   - A TRAILING SHELL COMMENT after the call, as in
#     `grep -qE "^x$" f  # tolerate \t here`. The unquoted-terminator set below
#     stops the walk at a shell metacharacter, and `#` is deliberately not in
#     it: an unquoted `#` is only a comment at the start of a word, and mid-word
#     it is an ordinary character a pattern may legitimately contain, which the
#     scan cannot tell apart without tokenizing. Fail-closed is the right side
#     to err on here, but the demanded repair points at a comment rather than at
#     any regex, so it is named rather than left to be discovered. There is no
#     pattern-side repair at all: hoisting the pattern into a variable leaves
#     the hit, because the escape is in the comment. Move the comment to its own
#     line, where the full-line skip below reaches it, or reword it.
#
# `$'...'` is NOT a hit, and the discrimination is load-bearing rather than
# cosmetic: `$'\r'` is one of the repairs this gate's own hint text advertises.
# Inside ANSI-C quoting the shell expands the escape and grep receives a real
# control character, so the pattern never carries the ambiguity. Flagging it
# would red the tree on the fix.
