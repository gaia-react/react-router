# archived-backlog-migrate.sh: one-time, human-gated, fail-closed removal of the
# pre-existing archived spec/plan backlog under .gaia/local/specs/archived and
# .gaia/local/plans/archived.
#
# The durable record for a merged spec or plan lives in the append-only cost
# ledger (cost.jsonl) plus the two id-ledgers (specs/ledger.json,
# plans/ledger.json). The archived folders duplicate it. This migration removes a
# folder only when BOTH gates pass:
#
#   Identity gate       - the folder has a durable id-ledger record at its
#                         terminal status: a specs/ledger.json row at status
#                         merged for a SPEC-<n> folder, or a plans/ledger.json row
#                         at status merged for a PLAN-<n> folder. A legacy
#                         free-form plan slug, or a spec that predates the ledger,
#                         has no durable identity: it classifies NEEDS-DECISION and
#                         is never auto-deleted; a human resolves it (synthesize an
#                         identity row, then re-run; or discard).
#   Representation gate - every cost.md phase section under the folder is
#                         value-represented in cost.jsonl (via
#                         cost_folder_represented). A folder holding an unparseable
#                         or unrepresented phase classifies BLOCKED and is never
#                         deleted.
#
# The migration is verify-only. It reads cost.jsonl but never writes it and never
# runs a backfill. A folder whose vintage cost.md phase has no matching ledger row
# classifies BLOCKED with reason needs-backfill; recovering it is a separate human
# step (run cost-backfill.sh whole-tree once, then re-run this migration).
#
# Usage: archived-backlog-migrate.sh [<repo_root>] [--confirm] [--ledger <path>]
#
#   Default (no --confirm) is a dry run: it prints a per-folder manifest and
#   deletes nothing. Only --confirm deletes, and only folders that pass both gates
#   (classified DELETE). BLOCKED and NEEDS-DECISION folders are never deleted, in
#   either mode.
#
# Guarantees:
#   - Exit code is ALWAYS 0 (advisory / fail-open); never blocks a caller.
#   - stdout carries the per-folder manifest and the summary; diagnostics go to
#     stderr only.
#   - The only mutation is rm -rf of a DELETE folder under --confirm. cost.jsonl is
#     byte-unchanged in both modes.
