# Enforced by the sibling bats suite
# .gaia/scripts/tests/lint-errexit-status-read.bats, which the `Audit CI Tests`
# CI job runs, and folded into .gaia/tests/shell-lint.sh so every shell-lint

#
# Why: an assignment takes the exit status of its command substitution, so under
# `set -e` a failing command terminates the script ON THE ASSIGNMENT LINE and
# the status read that follows never runs:
#
#     out="$(some_command ...)"
#     rc=$?                       # unreachable
#     if [[ $rc -ne 0 ]]; then    # dead, and so is everything it guards
#
# The observable outcome is a bare non-zero exit carrying none of the
# diagnostics the author wrote, and the branch that was supposed to handle the
# failure is never entered. Two instances of exactly this shape shipped in
# .github/actions/gaia-ci-merge-and-watch/action.yml (gaia-react/gaia#1477,
# gaia-react/gaia#1478); one of them silently disabled the whole post-merge
# revert escalation, because three later steps were gated on a step outcome that
# could no longer be reached, so a CI failure that could not be reverted
# escalated to nobody.
#
# The repair is always the same and never wrong -- move the status out of the
# assignment's way, so the shell has a chance to run the next line:
#
#     rc=0
#     out="$(some_command ...)" || rc=$?
#
# Why a repo-authored gate rather than a linter setting: three oracles were
# measured against the shape and none of them sees it.
#
#   - shellcheck 0.11.0 at severity `style`, the strictest floor
#     .gaia/tests/shell-lint.sh uses, exits 0 on the snippet above. SC2181 fires
#     on `if [ $? -ne 0 ]` after a PLAIN COMMAND and it does still fire on that
#     spelling here, but a capture into a variable draws nothing, and shellcheck
#     does not model `set -e` assignment status at all. The uncovered half is
#     therefore the capture, which is also the form both shipped instances took.
#   - actionlint v1.7 does not lint composite-action step bodies at all, which
#     .gaia/cli/test-fixtures/ci-shape/composite-actions.smoke.sh already
#     records.
#   - The `run:` bodies of workflows and composite actions are shell that no
#     `*.sh` glob reaches, so shell-lint's own discovery never opens the file
#     either shipped instance lived in.
#
# Scan surface, and the halves of it that arm differently:
#
#   tracked `*.sh` and the extensionless husky hooks -- armed only where the
#     file turns errexit on, tracked line by line so a `set +e` disarms and a
#     later `set -e` re-arms. Off by default is the truthful model here: a
#     script with no `set -e` does not carry the class at all, and roughly
#     twenty legitimate assignment/`rc=$?` pairs in this tree sit in exactly
#     such files. Arming unconditionally would demand a rewrite of every one of
#     them with no defect behind any.
#
#   `.github/workflows/`, `.github/actions/*/action.yml`, and the adopter
#     workflow templates under .gaia/cli/src/automation/templates/workflows/ --
#     `run:` bodies only, armed BY DEFAULT. GitHub Actions runs a step body as
#     `bash -e {0}` (and `bash -eo pipefail {0}` under an explicit
#     `shell: bash`), so errexit is on whether or not the body says so, which is
#     precisely why both shipped instances were live. A `set +e` inside the body
#     still disarms from that point.
#
# The templates render into an ADOPTER's CI, where a status read the author
# expected to run is skipped on a machine neither this repo's review nor the
# adopter's ever watches. That is this class one distribution hop further out,
# and it is the same reason the sibling run-interpolation and grep-escape gates
# scan them.
#
# `.gaia/cli/templates/workflows/` is a build artifact copied from `src/` by
# `bundle:adopter` and is deliberately NOT scanned, so no hit is reported twice
# and no report names a file the repair must not hand-edit.
#
#   tracked `*.bats` -- its own arm, armed BY DEFAULT, because bats runs every
#     test body under errexit while a suite file carries no `set -e` of its own.
#     Folding it into the `*.sh` set above, which is off by default, is what made
#     the whole surface read clean by construction rather than by measurement.
#
#     A suite is also where this class is DEMONSTRATED, so the line the gate
#     reads may be a fixture the test writes rather than shell the test runs.
#     Telling those apart is not this file's job: the shared
#     .gaia/scripts/guard-awk-lib.sh owns the argument-region rule, the
#     suppression pragma, and the invocation census, and all three gates that
#     scan suites read the same answers from it. The convention and the
#     reasoning behind it live in
#     wiki/decisions/Shell Guard Fixture Discrimination.md.
#
#     One arming rule is this gate's own rather than the library's. A helper
#     function defined in a suite whose EVERY invocation in that file is
#     `run <name>` is NOT armed, because bats disables errexit under `run`, so
#     the assignment hands its status to `run` and the read below it is live.
#     The library answers the census question; the exemption below is what turns
#     the answer into a verdict. Everything else stays armed: a body inside a
#     `@test`, a helper with at least one plain call site, and a helper with NO
#     call site at all in the file, that last one because an uninvoked helper is
#     evidence of nothing and fails closed.
#
#     The library's suppression pragma is honored on this surface and on no
#     other. A pragma naming this gate anywhere else it scans is reported as
#     waiving nothing, on the line it targets, whether or not that line carries
#     an instance -- reading it only where a hit fires would make the finding
#     silently inert over every pragma above a clean line, which is most of them.
#     Malformed pragmas, an unresolvable guard token or a missing reason, are the
#     sibling lint-git-path-quoting.sh's to report: it carries the widest scan
#     surface of the gates that read this pragma, so a malformed one anywhere in
#     the tree is named exactly once rather than once per gate. This gate reports
#     only the UNUSED pragma that names it.
#
# One file type is deliberately out of the surface:
#
#   *.md    -- the sibling path-quoting gate scans the fenced blocks of tracked
#              markdown because several are executed instruction. The same
#              fixture problem applies with more force here: this file's own
#              class documentation, and the wiki page describing the gate, both
#              have to SHOW the broken shape to explain it.
#
# What is deliberately NOT claimed, each because the status the read sees comes
# from somewhere other than the substitution:
#
#   - A PREFIXED assignment (`local out=$(cmd)`, and the same for `declare`,
#     `readonly`, `typeset`, and `export`). There the exit status belongs to the
#     builtin rather than to the substitution, so errexit does not fire and the
#     read is reachable -- it just always reads zero. That is a real defect and a
#     different one, and shellcheck already carries it as SC2155.
#   - An assignment whose status an AND-OR list CONSUMES rather than lets fall
#     to the shell: `out=$(cmd) || rc=$?`, and the same in a pipeline. That is
#     exactly what the repair above builds, so flagging it would red the tree on
#     the fix. The exemption is positional and this bullet claims only the
#     position it covers: errexit spares the NON-FINAL commands of an AND-OR
#     list, so a trailing `cond && out=$(cmd)` does exit, and that shape is a
#     blind spot below rather than a semantic non-issue.
#   - An ENV-PREFIX assignment (`FOO=$(cmd) run_thing`). The status belongs to
#     the prefixed command, so a failing substitution in the prefix never trips
#     errexit; `set -e; FOO=$(false) echo hi` runs and survives.
#   - An assignment used as an `if`/`while`/`until` CONDITION, which never
#     matches the assignment shape below because the line begins with the
#     keyword.
#
# Known FAIL-OPEN blind spots, stated rather than discovered later:
#   - A HEREDOC BODY is swallowed as data on every surface, so an instance
#     written inside one is never reported. That is the deliberate reading a
#     body is data the shell hands to a command rather than shell it runs, and
#     it is stated here as the fail-open it also is.
#   - The `run`-only exemption above is file-scoped, because the census that
#     feeds it reads one file. A helper called `run <name>` throughout its own
#     suite and called plainly from a `setup_suite` or a sourced helper file is
#     disarmed here on evidence that does not cover where it actually runs.
#   - A helper invoked only from inside a string (`bash -c "helper"`) is not
#     counted as invoked at all, so a helper otherwise reached only through `run`
#     keeps its exemption.
#   - An assignment in the FINAL position of an AND-OR list (`cond && out=$(cmd)`
#     with a status read below it). The shell does exit there, so it is the
#     class, and it is missed because a control operator anywhere in the
#     statement disqualifies it with no position tracking. Widening this needs
#     the walk to know which side of the operator the assignment sits on, which
#     is real parsing rather than a looser test, and no tracked file here writes
#     the shape.
#   - A statement whose first word ends on a LATER line than the one the
#     assignment starts on. The env-prefix exclusion reads the first top-level
#     whitespace as an offset into a single line, so a continued statement is
#     classified as a bare assignment.
#   - A `$?` reached through a variable indirection, or a status stored by a
#     `trap` body that a later line then reads. Both are genuinely deferred
#     reads whose value depends on when the body runs, which a line-oriented
#     scan cannot resolve.
#   - More than one heredoc opened on a single line (`cat <<A <<B`): only the
#     first delimiter is recorded, so the second body is read as shell.
#   - A `<<` inside a bare `(( ))` arithmetic command, as opposed to the `$(( ))`
#     expansion the walk does track, is read as a heredoc redirection. No tracked
#     file here uses the bare form.
#   - A step whose `shell:` is not bash (`python`, `pwsh`). Its body is armed as
#     bash would be, but the shape below is bash syntax that such a body does not
#     carry, so the arming costs nothing.
#   - A `run:` written as a multi-line plain or quoted flow scalar rather than a
#     block scalar; only its first line is read, the same bound the sibling
#     run-interpolation gate carries and for the same reason.
#   - An ANSI-C literal whose OPENER is split by a backslash continuation, the
#     `$` last on one line and the quote first on the next, is read as an
#     ordinary single quote. guard-awk-lib.sh states the same bound and declines
#     the same shape, deliberately: two tokenizers disagreeing about what one
#     sequence of bytes means is worse than a bound both of them hold. It does
#     not fail silently either way, since the misread quote leaves state open and
#     the desync verdict below fires.
#   - The ANSI-C frame is walk()'s. has_status_read() and eat_word() still read
#     `$\047...\047` as an ordinary single-quoted span, so an escaped quote
#     inside one flips their line-local quote state and a literal `$?` behind it
#     can read as a status read (a false positive) or a word boundary can be
#     misplaced in the env-prefix scan. Both are bounded to the single line each
#     one is handed, because neither carries state across lines, which is why
#     the repair went to the walk that does.
#
# Known FALSE POSITIVES, a third direction and the one worth naming explicitly
# because each costs a correct line a wrong verdict. None occurs in this tree.
# The group that used to dominate this list, a single-token exclusion stopping at
# the first prefix word, is closed: the exclusion below consumes the whole
# prefix, assignments and redirections alike, in any order, and applies itself to
# the command word behind it. Two further mechanisms close the rest of it: a
# redirection operand that is a nested command is followed as a REGION rather
# than broken on (eat_word() and walk() below), and the walk COUNTS top-level
# substitutions, so a statement whose status a second one supplies is not
# attributed to the first, which is the one this gate flags (W_nsub below).
#
# What is left is one UNDECIDABLE FAMILY rather than a list of unimplemented
# shapes, and it is undecidable in both directions at once:
#
#   - An assignment-only statement running TWO OR MORE substitutions. The shell
#     takes the status of the last one, so whether the read below is dead
#     depends on whether that last substitution fails, which is a runtime fact
#     no static reader has. The gate is quiet on the whole family, so it misses
#     the failing case (`out=$(false) FOO=$(false)` exits, and is the class).
#     Four spellings reach it and are ONE shape rather than four, because a word
#     boundary is not a distinction the shell draws here: a later prefix word
#     (`out=$(a) FOO=$(b)`), a redirection operand (`out=$(a) > "$(b)"`),
#     concatenation inside one value (`out="$(a)$(b)"`), and two adjacent quoted
#     words (`out="$(a)""$(b)"`). A substitution inside a `${...}` expansion
#     counts too, since the walk does not track `${`.
#     Quiet is chosen because the gate`s printed message names the flagged
#     substitution as the one whose failure exits, and with a later substitution
#     present that sentence is false: it names the wrong command and prints a
#     repair built around it, the direction that gets a gate bypassed rather
#     than obeyed. Reporting a single substitution is a decision under the same
#     uncertainty and is not a stronger claim, only one whose message is true.
#     Two kinds of substitution deliberately do NOT count toward the two,
#     because neither can be the last one the statement ran: a NESTED one
#     (`out=$(a $(b))`), and one inside a process-substitution operand
#     (`out=$(a) > >(echo "$(b)")`), which runs in an async subshell.
#
# Not a false positive, and here because it reads like one, a MODELLING DECISION
# that has been settled rather than left open:
#
#   - An INPUT redirection on an assignment-only statement (`out=$(cmd) < log`),
#     which is the one shape whose ground truth depends on the interpreter. Under
#     bash 3.2 the statement takes the substitution status and exits, so the read
#     below it is unreachable. Under bash 5 the status is reset to zero and the
#     read runs, ALWAYS READING ZERO while the command failed and the variable is
#     empty, so the failure is swallowed silently instead. Those are the same
#     defect approached from opposite sides, and the repair this gate prints
#     (`rc=0; out="$(cmd)" || rc=$?`) is correct under both, so the gate reports
#     under both and needs no version to target. An OUTPUT redirection in the
#     same position exits on either version, so only the input direction diverges
#     and only where no command word follows.
#
# This list is kept honest by measurement rather than by memory. The sibling bats
# suite ends with a differential test that runs a matrix of prefix shapes under a
# real shell and requires the gate to agree with what the shell did, so a shape
# stops being a bound when it is fixed rather than when someone remembers to edit
# this comment. Enumerating shapes by hand is what put four defects on the old
# exclusion across four review rounds, the last of them a silent fail-open.
#
# The matrix has a limit worth stating beside the list it verifies: it asserts
# AGREEMENT with the shell on rows it is given, so it reds when a listed row
# regresses and can never surface an UNLISTED false positive. Both entries above
# are also outside what it can measure, for two different reasons. The
# undecidable family has no single shell answer to agree with, since each
# spelling reaches or exits by the runtime status of its last substitution, so a
# row would pin whichever instance was written. The input-redirection decision
# has no version-independent one, so a row would record whichever interpreter
# the probe resolved as the contract. Its template also hardcodes a space before
# the suffix, so the same-word spellings cannot be expressed as rows at all.
# Named tests in the suite pin both, and this list is still maintained by hand.
#
# None of those fails SILENTLY. Tokenizer state is carried across lines, so any
# bound that loses sync leaves a quote, a substitution, or a heredoc open at the
# end of the region, and `check_desync` below reports the region as one this gate
# cannot certify rather than printing `clean` over lines it never read. That
# matters more than the bounds themselves: a line-oriented scan that desyncs
# swallows the REST OF THE FILE, not the rest of the statement, so the quiet
# failure is total rather than local.

#   W_nsub    how many TOP-LEVEL command substitutions the line opened, which
#             is a different question from whether it opened any. An
#             assignment-only statement takes the status of the LAST
#             substitution it ran, so with two or more, the one this gate flags,
#             the first, is not the one whose status the shell takes. Where the
#             second one SITS does not enter it: `out="$(a)$(b)"` and
#             `out=$(a) FOO=$(b)` are one statement to the shell, both reaching
#             the next line with `rc=0` when the last substitution succeeds, so
#             a word boundary is not a distinction this count may draw. The
#             depth-0 test excludes exactly the two kinds that cannot be the
#             last one this statement ran: a NESTED substitution, which
#             completes before the one containing it, and one inside a
#             process-substitution operand, which runs in an async subshell.
#
# Quoting is tracked INSIDE a substitution with the same machinery as outside
# it. Skipping the region and counting bare parentheses is the cheaper reading
# and it is wrong in the one direction that matters: a `)` inside a quoted
# string closes the region early, the walk resumes mid-string, and a lone
# apostrophe in the remaining literal opens a quote state that never closes.
# Because state is carried across lines, the rest of the FILE is then swallowed
# as quoted text and never classified, while this gate still prints `clean`.
# `.claude/hooks/block-env-read.sh` is the exemplar, where a `sed -E` pattern
# carries a `)` inside a bracket expression. No count is given: how many files
# reach the shape depends entirely on which counterfactual is measured, and three
# defensible readings give three different answers, so a number here would read
# as a measurement while naming none. The desync guard below is the second half of the answer: even a
