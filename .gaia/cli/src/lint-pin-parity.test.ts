/**
 * Maintainer drift-guards for what the two workspaces must agree on, each
 * asserted against the file that actually states it: the declared pins on each
 * manifest, the resolved version of every shared rule-bearing package on each
 * lockfile because no manifest states those, and the supply-chain hardening
 * settings on each `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
 *
 * They share one cause. `.gaia/cli` is its own pnpm workspace root, so it
 * inherits nothing from the repository root and every one of these values exists
 * twice with no mechanism holding the copies together.
 *
 * Nothing reported when the pin drifted. The gap reached two minors and a major
 * before anyone looked (#1051): both workspaces linted green against their own
 * pin, so CI said nothing while `.gaia/cli/src` was checked by a rule set the
 * rest of the repo had left behind.
 *
 * Repair, when the parity test below goes red: set
 * `.gaia/cli/package.json`'s `@gaia-react/lint` to the root `package.json`
 * version, then `pnpm -C .gaia/cli install` and `pnpm -C .gaia/cli lint`, and
 * fix what the newly-arrived rules surface.
 *
 * The preset pin fixes the preset's own DIRECT plugin set. The parity block
 * covers it together with the tools whose own version reaches lint output;
 * `LINT_OUTPUT_TOOLS` below owns that criterion and states what it leaves
 * uncovered.
 *
 * What it asserts is that the two manifests DECLARE the same version, never that
 * the two versions behave the same. The stronger claim is measurably false, and
 * on a smaller version distance than it sounds: two Prettier releases one patch
 * series apart can agree byte-for-byte across the whole tracked TypeScript corpus
 * and still disagree on Markdown, where the older one truncates a wikilink anchor
 * at its first colon and discards the rest of the heading. Today only the
 * TypeScript half is reachable, because `.gaia/cli` declares no format script and
 * its copy is driven solely by `eslint-plugin-prettier` over `src/**`. That is
 * wiring rather than a guarantee: the moment either workspace formats Markdown
 * with its own copy, a version difference starts rewriting content. Asserting on
 * the declared value is what keeps the guard from depending on which script
 * happens to exist.
 *
 * Repair, when a tool's parity test goes red: converge `.gaia/cli` UP to the root
 * version, never root down. The direction is not symmetric, because the older
 * formatter is the one that destroys content.
 *
 * A whole class of rule-bearing package cannot be guarded on the manifest pin at
 * all, so the second describe block below asserts on the lockfiles instead.
 * `typescript-eslint` is the clearest case: a direct dependency of neither
 * workspace and pinned by neither the preset nor a manifest, it arrives
 * transitively through `eslint-config-airbnb-extended`, whose own range for it is
 * a caret, so each workspace's lockfile freezes it independently at whatever that
 * caret resolved to on the day the lockfile was last written. The two can
 * therefore sit on different versions with every manifest assertion green, which
 * matters because every `@typescript-eslint/*` rule implementation and every
 * `tseslint.configs.*` preset comes from there.
 *
 * The mechanism is the arrival path rather than the package, so the guard covers
 * the packages that arrive that way AND announce themselves as rule providers by
 * name: every one of them resolves in both lockfiles and any can float apart the
 * same way. Which ones earn parity is decided by the naming convention at
 * `RULE_PACKAGE_PATTERN` below, not by a list, so a plugin that arrives later is
 * guarded on arrival; a package that should NOT be compared by version is named
 * in `PARITY_EXEMPT` with its reason, and that is the only way out.
 *
 * The convention is the selector, so a package arriving by the same caret under a
 * different naming family is outside this guard. The import-resolution family sits
 * inside it (#1269): the resolvers and `eslint-module-utils` arrive by the same
 * caret and decide whether an unresolved-import rule can answer at all, so
 * `RULE_PACKAGE_PATTERN` selects them and `PARITY_EXEMPT` disposes of them
 * individually, which is the instrument this file already uses for a matched
 * package no workspace loads.
 *
 * The rule in play there is `import-x/no-unresolved`. `eslint-plugin-import`
 * contributes no enabled rule to either workspace's resolved config, so it is
 * exempted below as a plugin no workspace loads, and the resolver list is
 * `import-x`'s own node resolver plus `eslint-import-resolver-typescript`, which
 * is why that resolver is the one family member earning a version comparison
 * while `eslint-import-resolver-node` and `eslint-module-utils` are exempted
 * below. Both readings come from `eslint --print-config`, the instrument the
 * criterion paragraph below names.
 *
 * The criterion behind both, worth stating once: parity is worth enforcing for a
 * package whose rules a workspace actually runs, and worth nothing for one whose
 * rules neither enables. That question is answered per package by reading the
 * resolved configs (`eslint --print-config`) and recording the answer as an
 * exemption, rather than by computing it here. Computing it would need the ROOT
 * workspace installed, and the job that runs this file installs `.gaia/cli` alone
 * (`cli-tests.yml`), so the check would have to add a full root install to a
 * required context to compare version strings.
 *
 * Repair, when the lockfile parity test goes red: re-resolve the LAGGING
 * workspace for the package the failure names, `pnpm update <package>` from its
 * own root, and fix what the newly-arrived rules surface. Do not reach for an
 * exact pin to hold the two together. A direct dependency outside
 * `eslint-config-airbnb-extended`'s range does not error, it installs a second
 * copy while the rules keep coming from airbnb-extended's, so the pin goes
 * decorative and this guard reads it and passes. Asserting on the resolved
 * version is what keeps the failure loud.
 *
 * Fires on the pull request that causes the drift: root `package.json`,
 * `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` are each in the `code` paths
 * filter of `cli-tests.yml`, whose `Vitest (.gaia/cli)` job is a declared-required
 * context. Keep an entry for every subject named above, because each guard has
 * a different root-side trigger: a manifest bump for the declared pins, a
 * re-resolve for the transitive version (which touches no manifest at all), and a
 * settings edit for the hardening. Without them a guard first fires on some
 * later, unrelated `.gaia/cli/**` change. Every `.gaia/cli` side is already covered by
 * `.gaia/cli/**`.
 *
 * Maintainer-only by construction: `.gaia/cli/src` and `.gaia/cli/package.json`
 * are both release-excluded, so adopters carry neither this test nor its
 * subject.

//
// A named set rather than the naming convention `RULE_PACKAGE_PATTERN` uses

//
// The honest limit, in two directions, neither hypothetical. A tool that starts
// reaching lint output later is silent until someone edits this set, which is the
// default-silence the pattern below exists to avoid. And the parity shape needs a
// value on BOTH sides, so a lint-output-reaching package only one manifest
// declares is out of reach of the shape rather than out of scope of the
// criterion: `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` is exactly that, a direct dependency
// here that root supplies through its `publicHoistPattern` instead, and
// `prettier.config.mjs` in this workspace already records it as unguarded.
// Widening both is a decision about the criterion rather than a missing entry, so
// it is tracked (#1755) rather than taken here. Under-covering is the safe
// direction: the alternative is comparing a version one side never states.

// failure mode: it makes the DEFAULT silence, so a plugin that arrives later
// through the same caret is unguarded until someone remembers it, which is how
// the audit roster lost four files to #813 and three more to #1243. A pattern
// makes the default coverage, closes the family permanently, and over-matches
// only in the safe direction, since a package it catches that neither workspace
// enables costs an exemption below rather than a missed drift.
//
// Each arm matches something today (asserted, so a broken arm cannot pass
// vacuously): a scoped provider (`@stylistic/eslint-plugin`,
// `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`), an unscoped one (`eslint-plugin-unicorn`,
// `eslint-config-prettier`), the `eslint-import-resolver-` family, the bare
// `typescript-eslint` meta-package, which follows no convention because it is the
// flat-config entry point rather than a plugin, and the bare
// `eslint-module-utils`. `eslint-config-*` is in deliberately: a shared config
// decides which rules exist at all (`eslint-config-airbnb-extended`) or turns
// them off wholesale (`eslint-config-prettier`), so it changes the effective rule
// set as surely as a plugin does.
//
// The import-resolution arms (#1269) are here because a resolver answers whether
// a specifier resolves at all, which is what `import-x/no-unresolved` reports on,
// so a resolver difference is a difference in what each workspace considers an
// error in exactly the sense this guard exists to catch. They arrive by the same
// `eslint-config-airbnb-extended` caret as everything else here and announce
// themselves by a stable npm naming family, so the convention-over-list argument
// that justifies the arms above justifies these.
//
// `eslint-module-utils` is a bare name because it is one package under no naming
// family, which is the same ground `typescript-eslint` beside it stands on. The
// honest limit: a bare name covers the package rather than the class, so another
// unprefixed participant in import resolution is outside this selector until
// someone names it, which is the default-silence a pattern otherwise avoids.
// Under-covering is the safe direction, and the alternative, selecting on the
// resolved config rather than the name, needs a root install the criterion
// paragraph in the docblock rules out.
//
// `@typescript-eslint/parser` is absent by name and covered anyway: the

// own exact version, so the parser cannot float away from a guarded meta-package.

// including the scope-aware `@` split that keeps `@scope/name` from splitting on
// its own leading `@`.
//
// One deliberate divergence, stated because a wrong normalization here is the
// same false-positive class this exists to fix: pnpm runs each version through
// `semver.valid`, which also folds spellings like `=1.2.3` and `v1.2.3` onto
// `1.2.3`. Trimming is all that pnpm's OWN output needs (its union separator

// still red. Add the dependency and use `semver.valid` if that ever happens; do
// not grow a second normalizer by hand, which is how the sibling exactness
// predicate accumulated four rounds of shape-by-shape repair.
//
// A name-only entry stays one atom, so exempting EVERY version of a package in
// `.gaia/cli` is not contained by exempting one version of it at root. That is
// asymmetric hardening and stays red, which is pnpm's reading too.

  // an ordinary install. Rejecting it would red a required context over a list
  // pnpm authored, every entry of which is the exact-version exemption this

  //
  // Both character classes allow uppercase. npm has required lowercase only for
