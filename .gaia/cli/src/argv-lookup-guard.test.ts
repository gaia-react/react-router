/**
 * Maintainer guard: a string-keyed lookup table is never read by a bare index.
 *
 * A bare index into a `Record<string, …>` resolves every `Object.prototype`
 * member, so a table read with an externally-supplied key returns a truthy
 * inherited value for `constructor`, `toString`, `__proto__`, and the rest.
 * The value then survives the caller's `=== undefined` check and is dispatched
 * or consumed as though it named a real entry.
 *
 * # Why this needs a guard rather than a sweep
 *
 * The class recreates itself out of ordinary editing. A new subcommand domain
 * is written by copying an existing `index.ts`, and whether the copy carries
 * the guard depends on which file was copied: ten dispatchers were unguarded
 * against three that were, all from the same template. Nothing reported it,
 * because the wrong behavior only shows for argv tokens nobody types by
 * accident, and two of the outcomes are a silent exit 0.
 *
 * Routing every read through `util/argv.ts`'s `lookupOwn` is what makes the
 * guard non-optional; this test is what keeps a bare index from reappearing in
 * the shape that produced the class, a module-level dispatch or flag table.
 *
 * # What this does not reach
 *
 * A floor, not a proof of absence. The scan reads annotations literally, so
 * two shapes present in the tree are invisible to it: a table annotated
 * through a type alias (`const VALUE_FLAGS: ValueFlagMap<…>`, whose alias
 * resolves to a string-keyed `Record` in another module) and a table declared
 * inside a function body. Neither is read by a bare index today, and the alias
 * cases are read only through `parseValueFlags`, which routes to `lookupOwn`.
 * Resolving an alias means following it across modules, which is a type
 * checker's job rather than a line scanner's; until something needs it, the
 * honest statement is that a bare index in those two shapes passes unreported.
 *
 * # What counts as an offense
 *
 * A `NAME[`, `NAME?.[`, or `NAME [` read of a `const NAME` whose declared type
 * is a string-keyed `Record`, unless that same line guards it with
 * `Object.hasOwn(NAME,`. The exemption names the table rather than the line, so
 * a guard on one table never excuses a bare read of another beside it.
 *
 * The declared type is read from the joined declaration head, not the opening
 * line: every dispatcher spells its table across three lines, and a single-line
 * test matched none of them while reporting the tree clean.
 *
 * Union-keyed tables (`Record<ToolId, …>`) are exempt: the compiler already
 * proves the key is a member, so no prototype key can reach them.
 *
 * Repair, when this goes red: read through `lookupOwn(TABLE, key)`.
 *
 * Maintainer-only by construction: `.gaia/cli/src` is release-excluded, so an
 * adopter clone carries neither these sources nor this test, and the suite
 * skips there. Mirrors `command-reachability.test.ts`.
