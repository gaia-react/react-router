/**
 * Detects which finding classes a promoted rule already covers.
 *
 * An approved policy-memory rule under `.claude/rules/` carries a provenance
 * marker naming the class it was promoted from:
 *
 *   <!-- gaia-harden: promoted from recurring finding_class <class>; ... -->
 *
 * v1 keys coverage on that marker alone: a class with a marker present is
 * already enforced, so the tally drops it. Reading rule bodies is cheap and the
 * marker is a single line, so this scans every `*.md` under the rules dir.
