/**
 * Maintainer drift-guard for the outbound references in the rendered
 * `gaia-ci` workflow templates: the four per-tool ones and the scheduler
 * that calls them.
 *
 * These templates render into an adopter's `.github/workflows/`, but the
 * maintainer repo runs none of them, so, unlike `code-review-audit.yml`
 * (guarded byte-for-byte by `audit-template-dogfood.test.ts`) there is no
 * in-tree counterpart to diff against. The snapshot and YAML-shape suites
 * guard the render *source*; nothing guards the GAIA skills and CLI
 * subcommands the templates invoke by name in their prompt and run steps.
 * Rename the `/gaia-wiki` skill, or the `wiki sync land` CLI verb, and an
 * adopter's CI silently invokes a command that no longer exists.
 *
 * This guard pins an explicit contract, the skills and CLI leaf commands
 * each template is expected to invoke, and asserts four things:
 *   1. the on-disk `gaia-ci` template set matches the contract keys, so a
 *      new template forces a contract entry;
 *   2. every declared reference still appears in its template, so a silent
 *      drop or divergence of the invocation fails here;
 *   3. every declared target still exists, the skill directory under
 *      `.claude/skills/`, and the CLI path against the live routers; and
 *   4. no template invokes a real skill it has not declared, so adding a
 *      `/<skill>` to an existing template forces a contract update rather
 *      than slipping through unguarded.
 *
 * Completeness has one accepted gap, and it is **check 4's alone**: an
 * *undeclared CLI* invocation added to an existing template is not
 * auto-detected. Template prompt prose mixes executed `gaia <cmd>` calls with
 * step labels (`- name: Run gaia wiki chain`), so EXTRACTING CLI invocations
 * from the text yields false positives; check 4 therefore covers skills only,
 * and the CLI half of the contract stays declared by hand. Skills carry no
 * such ambiguity, a `/<slug>` token preceded by whitespace or a backtick that
 * resolves to a real skill directory is unambiguously an invocation.
 *
 * The gap does not reach check 2, and reading it as though it did is what left
 * `#1271` sitting as a fork. Check 4 has to decide, unprompted, whether a
 * `gaia <cmd>` string in the text is an invocation; check 2 is told which
 * string to look for and only asks whether it is still there. Extraction is
 * what the false positives attach to, so a check that extracts nothing does not
 * inherit them, and recognizing the declared string in more of its written
 * forms costs nothing the narrower spelling was buying. That is why check 2's
 * CLI half matches through the shared `matchesShippedInvocation`
 * (`util/gaia-invocation-matcher.ts`) and check 4, which does extract, keeps
 * the narrower `SKILL_REF_PATTERN` lookbehind.
 *
 * Check 2's own honest limit, unchanged by any of that: it asserts the declared
 * string appears **somewhere in the template text**, prose and step labels
 * included, not that the template executes it. `- name: Run gaia wiki sync
 * land nightly` satisfies it, and satisfied it under the substring test too.
 * So a green check 2 is evidence the reference has not been silently dropped,
 * which is the drift it exists to catch, and is not evidence of a live `run:`
 * step; nothing here guards that, and the quote class admits nothing the
 * substring test did not already admit.
 *
 * The complementary `command-reachability.test.ts` guards the inverse
 * direction (every CLI leaf command has some external invoker). It cannot
 * catch this drift: `wiki sync land` and `update-deps run` are invoked from
 * skills and wiki pages too, so a stale template reference keeps a live
 * invoker elsewhere and that guard stays green.
 *
 * Maintainer-only by construction: `.gaia/cli/src` is release-excluded, so
 * this test is absent on adopter clones. It also skips gracefully on any
 * checkout where the templates or routers are missing, mirroring the
 * sibling guards.
