/**
 * Maintainer drift-guard for the third-party action pins in the workflow
 * templates, the ones that render an adopter's `.github/workflows/`.
 *
 * A major tag (`actions/checkout@v5`) is a moving ref: it resolves to whatever
 * the tag points at the moment an adopter's CI runs, so a force-moved upstream
 * tag executes in the adopter's job with that job's token. Every template
 * therefore pins to a full-length commit SHA with the resolved tag in a
 * trailing comment, which is the convention `code-review-audit.yml.tmpl`
 * already states in its own header.
 *
 * Pinning alone would trade a mutable ref for a frozen one. `.tmpl` files sit
 * outside `.github/workflows/`, so Dependabot cannot see them
 * (`.github/dependabot.yml` says so in writing), and a frozen pin nobody
 * advances means adopters stop receiving upstream patches. The parity test
 * below (`every template pin matches the pin the maintainer workflows run`) is
 * the mechanism that keeps them moving: it asserts each template pin against
 * the pin the maintainer's own workflows run, which Dependabot bumps weekly.
 * Named rather than numbered, because an ordinal points at whichever test
 * happens to sit in that slot after the next insertion, and a maintainer
 * following it to diagnose a bump-drift red opens the wrong one. A bump lands in `.github/workflows/` first and turns this red until
 * the same pin is mirrored into the template. That is the same red-then-mirror
 * flow `dependabot.yml` already documents for `code-review-audit.yml`.
 *
 * The mirrored template reaches adopters on their next `/update-gaia`, which
 * does NOT re-render an installed workflow: `/update-gaia` refreshes
 * `code-review-audit.yml` alone, and the `gaia-ci-*` workflows this partial
 * feeds are re-rendered only by `/setup-gaia`, whose drift check offers that
 * path. So the pin reaches an adopter's running CI on their next `/setup-gaia`,
 * not before.
 *
 * Repair, when the parity test goes red: copy the `<sha> # <tag>` the failure
 * message names from the maintainer workflows into the template site it names,
 * then regenerate the render snapshots (`pnpm test --run -u` in `.gaia/cli`).
 *
 * Maintainer-only by construction: `.gaia/cli/src` is release-excluded, so this
 * test is absent on adopter clones. The parity test additionally skips when
 * `.github/workflows/` is absent, mirroring the sibling guards.
