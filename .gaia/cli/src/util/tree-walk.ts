 * corpus and reads the resulting empty answer as a clean pass.
 *
 * Normalization is unconditional: a POSIX-separated entry is correct for every
 * caller, and a caller that compares an entry against a repo-relative module
 * path breaks without it.
 *
 * Only regular files are reported, so a caller may read each entry without
 * stating it first: a directory whose own name carries a matching extension
 * would otherwise reach `readFileSync` and throw `EISDIR`. A symlink is not a
 * regular file here, so the walk does not follow one, and a caller that needs
 * to owns that stat.
 *
 * No directory is excluded. A caller that walks a tree holding a build or
 * vendor directory owns that filter, which is the honest shape while no caller
 * does: an exclusion carried here for no live caller is a rule nobody can
 * check.
 *
 * A `root` that does not exist throws, the way `readdirSync` does. Silence
 * there would be the discovery-stage fail-open this walk exists to close.
