/**
 * The shared `gaia <command>` invocation matcher for the maintainer CLI guards.
 *
 * Two guards ask whether a command is invoked in some text, from opposite
 * directions, and both need the same answer:
 *
 *   * `command-reachability.test.ts` asks whether *any* invoker exists for a
 *     leaf command, so a command nobody calls fails there.
 *   * `automation/__tests__/gaia-ci-template-refs.test.ts` asks whether the
 *     invocation a `gaia-ci-*` template's contract declares still appears in
 *     that template, so a silent drop fails there.
 *
 * `#1037` taught the first guard to read a quoted binary path. `#1271` found
 * the second still deciding the same question with a bare `includes('gaia ' +
 * command)` substring test, which cannot see that form, and extracted the
 * matcher here rather than copying it into a second file: a hand-copied second
 * regex is the class `#1720` drained, and the two guards diverging on what
 * counts as an invocation is precisely the failure `#1271` recorded.
 *
 * Test-only, though nothing here is test-specific: both consumers are
 * `.test.ts` files, so this module is unreachable from `src/index.ts` and none
 * of it enters the bundled binary. It is not named `*-fixture.ts` for that
 * reason. The three that are (`repo-root-fixture.ts`,
 * `non-ascii-path-fixture.ts`, `main-checkout-fixture.ts`) supply values or
 * environment to other suites and have no behavior of their own to assert;
 * this is a matcher with its own test beside it, and naming it for what it is
 * keeps that suffix meaning the one thing it means.
 *
 * Maintainer-only by construction: `.gaia/cli/src` is release-excluded, so an
 * adopter clone carries neither this module nor its consumers.

// An invocation-shaped string for `commandPath` in `text`: the binary name,
// optionally closed by a quote, then the space-separated path, bounded so
// `wiki state` never matches inside `wiki state-bump`.
//
// The quote class is what lets a **release-resolved** invocation count. A
// subcommand invoked only as `"$LATEST_DIR/.gaia/cli/gaia" update merge-region`
// puts a closing quote exactly where the separator is required, so without the
// class the guard reads a live command as dead and the author has to mention
// its bare form somewhere else to clear a red. Note the narrower fix does not
// exist: an *unquoted* path prefix already matched, because `/` is neither
// `\w` nor `-`, so the quote is the whole of the blind spot.
//
// The quote is admitted beside the separator and never instead of it, so a
// bare path with no separator at all stays excluded.
// `.gaia/tests/distribution/17-gaia-update-merge-region.sh` reached the same
// `gaia"?` shape for the same reason.
//
// Takes its haystack as an argument rather than closing over a guard's own
// corpus, so the pattern itself can be exercised against fixture strings.
// Reading the oracle only through the whole repository's text cannot show the
// difference between "this form is unmatchable" and "no such invocation exists
// here".
//
// Both classes are parameters for the same reason: each consumer needs a
// different value, and a hand-copied second regex would drift from this one
// silently. `binaryClass` is which binaries count (see the exports below, which
// is where the choice is argued); `quoteClass` exists so the pre-widening shape
// stays available as a control. Only the three exported matchers pass either
// one, and each pins both values.
