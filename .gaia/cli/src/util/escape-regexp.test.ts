/**
 * Strategy: `escapeRegExp` is pure, so every case calls it directly. What this
 * suite owns is the **escape set itself**, which is the reason the helper has
 * one home: its call sites build guards whose matching behaviour is decided by
 * which characters get escaped, and no call site asserts that set.
 *
 * The set is pinned two ways on purpose. The character-by-character table is
 * the readable statement of intent; the round-trip cases are the ones that
 * would actually catch a wrong escape, because a metacharacter that survives
 * unescaped still produces a *valid* regex, just one that matches the wrong
 * strings.
