 *
 *   `.claude/commands/tool.sh` <!-- gaia:hypothetical .claude/commands/tool.sh: why -->
 *
 * The path inside the marker is written unbackticked. Backticks are kept
 * verbatim in the declared path, so a backticked one matches no token, and the
 * marker then exempts nothing *and* reports itself unused.
 *
 * A central allowlist is the obvious alternative and it cannot self-scope. The
 * bundle-time scrub strips a maintainer-only block from a page an adopter
 * receives, so a list entry covering a line inside one ships in the binary
 * while the line it exempts does not, and that clone is then blind to a
 * genuinely dead future citation of the same path. A marker is stripped by the
 * same scrub that strips its subject, and an adopter writing their own page can
 * reach for it at all: neither property is available to a list held in this
 * file, which adopters receive only as a compiled binary.
 *
 * The mandatory reason and the stale-marker report are `gaia-lint-ignore
 * <guard>: <reason>`'s two safety properties, taken for the reason that pragma
 * has them: without the report, an in-prose marker decays exactly as a list
 * entry does, only less visibly.
 *
 * Comparison is on NFC because an accented path has two legal spellings and
 * string equality compares code points: macOS filesystems and some editors
 * hand back NFD (`e` + U+0301) where prose typed in an editor is NFC (U+00E9).
