/**
 * The `wiki/**` markdown corpus the wiki scanner subcommands read, and the
 * vocabulary they state their exemptions from it in.
 *
 * The corpus and the exemptions live together because their boundaries
 * coincide: a scanner that shares this walk is asking about the same set of
 * pages, so it is also answering the same question about which of them are
 * worth reading. The exemptions are two tiers rather than one list, and each
 * tier's docblock below owns the warrant that decides who may take it; a
 * scanner adds its own narrower entries at its own site, with its own reason.
 *
 * Each scanner asks the same question of the tree before it asks its own:
 * which markdown pages exist under `wiki/`, named the way the rest of the
 * repository names them. Answering it per subcommand is the drift the shared
 * walk exists to close one level down, reintroduced one level up: a scanner's
 * corpus is exactly the set it is trusted to have read, and a private answer
 * that stops normalizing a separator or misses a nested page still returns a
 * plausible list and still greens.
 *
 * An absent `wiki/` directory yields an empty corpus rather than throwing.
 * That is the scanners' own contract with their callers: `gaia wiki` runs on a
 * clone that has not seeded a wiki yet, and reporting nothing found is the
 * honest answer there.
 *
 * The guard reads every `statSync` failure as absence, not `ENOENT` alone, so a
 * `wiki/` that exists but cannot be stated, a symlink loop or a parent without
 * `+x`, also yields an empty corpus and a clean pass over a tree nothing read.
 * That is an accepted miss rather than the condition the guard states: which
 * errors should stop a scan is a question about the scanners, and narrowing it
 * here would answer it for all three without any of them asking.

 * page is overwritten rather than edited. That reasoning covers a dead citation
 * (`dead-paths`) and an empty section (`empty-sections`), and it does not
 * cover a schema question: a frontmatter gap in a generated page is entirely
 * actionable, at the renderer that generates it, and `gaia wiki frontmatter`
 * is the only scan that would surface such a break before `gaia wiki
 * log-prepend` fails on it. So `frontmatter` takes the base tier above and
 * this one is deliberately not offered to it.
 *
 * Matched exactly, not by prefix: these name two files, and a prefix would
 * also swallow any page whose path merely starts with one of them.
 *
 * These two and the base entry together are the Exceptions list in
 * `.claude/rules/wiki-style.md`, and that correspondence still holds
 * undivided: the rule exempts all three from a prose rule about inline
 * historical references, which is a question about the pages themselves. The
 * split into two tiers here is about which *scan* may take which exemption,
 * which that rule never spoke to, so it needs no counterpart there.
