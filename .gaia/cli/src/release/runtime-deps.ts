/**
 * `gaia-maintainer release runtime-deps` handler.
 *
 * Catches the class of leak that the bundle-time scrub cannot see:
 * runtime references in shipped scripts that resolve to release-excluded
 * paths. Lexical scrubbing strips marker-delimited prose, but a hook that
 * spawns `bash .gaia/scripts/foo.sh` keeps working in the maintainer's
 * tree and silently breaks on adopter clones if `.gaia/scripts/` is
 * release-excluded.
 *
 * Walks shipped shell scripts under `.gaia/statusline/`,
 * `.gaia/cli/templates/`, `.gaia/scripts/`, `.claude/hooks/`,
 * `.github/actions/`, `.github/audit/`, and
 * `.specify/extensions/gaia/lib/` (recursing into nested directories) and
 * extracts their repo-relative path constants.
 *
 * The scan surface depends on the mode. A bare run walks the repo root, which
 * also holds release-excluded scripts, so it scans only the files carrying a
 * manifest entry; that is what makes it agree with the authoritative
 * `--staging` run. A `--staging` run scans every script in the extracted
 * tarball unfiltered, because the tarball is the ground truth for what shipped.
 *
 * Each extracted path constant is verified to be either:
 *
 *   - present in `.gaia/manifest.json` (a shipped file), or
 *   - an adopter-owned sentinel (`wiki/hot.md`, `wiki/log.md`,
 *     `.gaia/VERSION`, `.gaia/manifest.json`), or
 *   - a runtime-allocated path on adopter machines (under
 *     `.gaia/local/`, `.claude/handoff/`,
 *     `.claude/worktrees/`, `.claude/agent-memory/`, `.claude/audit/`,
 *     or one of the per-session marker files).
 *
 * Anything else is a runtime-dependency leak.
 *
 * Read-only. No writes anywhere.
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0: no leaks
 *   1: leaks detected, missing inputs, bad flags
 *   2: unexpected (manifest parse failure, IO error)

/**
 * Path tokens referenced inside shipped scripts that are NOT runtime
 * dependencies, so they must not be reported as leaks. Two categories:
 * descriptive prose (an in-scope directory named as an example in
 * operator-facing error/help text), and path constants the script feeds to
 * git plumbing (`git diff`, `git cat-file`) rather than sourcing or invoking,
 * which resolve to a benign "absent" branch when the file is not installed.
 *
 * Entries are exact, fully-qualified tokens (the trimmed output of
 * `extractPathRefs`). Exact-match is deliberate: allowlisting
 * `.github/workflows` does NOT suppress a genuine leak to a file under it,
 * `.github/workflows/foo.yml` is a distinct, longer token that still flags.
 * This is the documented channel for false-positives, add the exact token
 * plus a justification rather than reword the reference.
 *
 * A reference carrying a shell pattern is the one qualification on that: it
 * reduces to the directory holding the family (see `expandPath`), so it is
 * adjudicated against this allowlist as that directory rather than as the
 * longer token its literal spelling would produce.
 *
 *   - `.github/workflows`: named in `.claude/hooks/pr-merge-audit-check.sh`'s
 *     merge-gate error message as an example in-scope path, alongside `app/`,
 *     `test/`, `configs`. The directory is release-excluded; the reference is
 *     descriptive, not an invocation. An inline-ignore comment cannot annotate
 *     the occurrence because it lives inside a multi-line quoted `reason="..."`
 *     string that renders to the operator, hence this central allowlist.
 *   - `.github/workflows/code-review-audit.yml`: the workflow path constant in
 *     the same hook's `check_self_mod_only_update_pr()` bypass. It is compared
 *     against the PR's changed-file list and against the bundled template's
 *     git blob; it is never sourced or executed. The file is release-excluded
 *     (installed on demand by `/setup-gaia`), and when absent on an adopter
 *     clone the path simply never appears in the diff, so the bypass returns
 *     the normal deny. A path constant, not a runtime dependency.
 *   - `.claude/projects`: Claude Code's own global session-transcript
 *     directory, `$HOME/.claude/projects`, referenced by
 *     `token-tally-review.sh`. It lives outside the repo on every machine and
 *     structurally can never have a manifest entry.
 *   - `.claude/settings.local.json`: Claude Code's own per-machine settings
 *     layer, gitignored on both sides, so it structurally can never have a
 *     manifest entry. `check-hook-command-rooting.sh` gates on its presence
 *     AND on it registering hooks, then names it in the note it prints, to
 *     say which registration surface the check does NOT cover. Absent on an
 *     adopter clone the gate is simply false and the note never prints, so
 *     the reference resolves to a benign absent branch rather than a
 *     dependency. THREE occurrences extract and this one entry suppresses all
 *     three: the gate's two `"$repo_root/.claude/settings.local.json"`
 *     references and the printf note. The two rooted ones are extracted
 *     rather than skipped precisely BECAUSE they sit in a variable-expansion
 *     context: that context is what disables the substring skip, since the
 *     static half of `$VAR/<path>` is the project-relative path this scan
 *     wants. `runtime-deps.test.ts` asserts that exact set with the allowlist
 *     bypassed, so any reword that stops one of them extracting fails the
 *     unit suite rather than the release gate.
 *   - `.claude/shell-snapshots`: Claude Code's own per-Bash-call snapshot
 *     wrapper directory, referenced inside `SNAPSHOT_WRAPPER_PATTERN`, a
 *     regex literal in `spec-session-lock.sh` that MATCHES/REJECTS the
 *     wrapper's command line. It is never sourced or executed, just compared
 *     against, so it cannot be a runtime dependency.
