/**
 * Lockstep guard for the maintainer-only marker strip (#1742).
 *
 * `stripMarkerBlocks` is the parser the release scrub actually runs, and the
 * bats suites carry hand-written awk models of it so they can strip a script
 * and then RUN the stripped copy without taking a dependency on the maintainer
 * CLI. Nothing held those models to the parser: a change to the TypeScript
 * state machine left every model behind with nothing red, and the suites would
 * go on certifying a stripped copy the release scrub does not produce.
 *
 * # Which direction the dependency runs, and why
 *
 * This guard follows `exclude-parser-parity.test.ts`: TypeScript reaches for
 * the shell text, rather than a bats suite reaching for the CLI. The models
 * stay dependency-free standalone bash, which is what they are for, and the
 * binding lives here where the parser lives.
 *
 * # What it asserts
 *
 * 1. `stripMarkerBlocks` and `AWK_PROGRAM` produce identical bytes over a
 *    fixture corpus covering every branch of the state machine, with one
 *    named exemption `UNTERMINATED_START` documents.
 * 2. Every suite carrying the model holds `BATS_AWK_BLOCK` verbatim, so a
 *    model that drifts from the program this file just proved faithful goes
 *    red here.
 * 3. Every such suite declares a delimiter pair that a marker-strip transform
 *    in `.gaia/release-scrub.yml` actually uses, so a suite cannot strip and
 *    pass against a spelling the release retired. The pair is per suite
 *    because the surfaces differ: a suite stripping shell reads the
 *    `#`-comment transform, one stripping markdown the HTML-comment transform.
 *
 * The corpus runs against one delimiter pair rather than every declared pair,
 * and that is not a gap: both sides take their markers as parameters, so the
 * state machine cannot branch on the spelling. Assertion 1 proves the machine
 * and assertion 3 proves the spellings, each once.
 *
 * # What it does not catch
 *
 * Discovery reads the git index, so a model in a suite that is written but not
 * yet staged is not enrolled. That fails in the safe direction: CI audits the
 * committed tree, so the suite is enrolled by the time it can gate anything,
 * and the miss is bounded to the authoring session that added it.
 *
 * A model written in some other shape entirely, a `sed` range or an awk with
 * its own variable names, carries no `BATS_AWK_INVOCATION` and so is not
 * discovered. That residue is not decidable by text: recognizing an arbitrary
 * hand-rolled strip needs a reader. What the guard does guarantee is that a
 * site converted to this invocation stays converted, and converting a site is
 * what enrolls it.
 *
 * Maintainer-only by construction: `.gaia/cli/src` is release-excluded, so an
 * adopter clone carries neither `marker-strip.ts` nor this test.
