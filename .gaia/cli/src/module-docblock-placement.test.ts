/**
 * Maintainer guard: a module docblock precedes the file's first import.
 *
 * A `/** … *\/` block placed *below* the first import no longer documents the
 * module. JSDoc binds by adjacency, so it attaches to whatever follows it —
 * usually the next `import` statement — and the file's primary explanation is
 * silently misattributed to a dependency.
 *
 * # Why this needs a guard rather than a sweep
 *
 * The class recreates itself out of ordinary editing, so fixing the instances
 * alone buys a diff that decays. Imports are sorted by specifier, and a
 * docblock written above what was then the first import is left behind the
 * moment an import that sorts higher is added. Nobody chooses this and nothing
 * reports it: 81 files had accumulated when `#1163` measured the class, against
 * a single instance (`#1034`) that had been fixed one-at-a-time on the
 * assumption it was unique.
 *
 * The convention is therefore asserted rather than merely swept: 126 files led
 * with their docblock deliberately, and every file that did not was an artifact
 * of the sort. `#1034` had already accepted the correctness argument.
 *
 * # What counts as an offense
 *
 * A `/**`-opening block comment inside the file's LEADING import block that is
 * followed by a blank line or by another import. Both are positions no author
 * picks for a declaration's JSDoc, so both indicate a module docblock that the
 * sort has stranded.
 *
 * The leading import block is the header region only: it ends at the first
 * statement that is not an import, a comment, or blank. A file may open with
 * its docblock, import, and then import again further down beside the code that
 * needs it (`setup-ci/__tests__/sandbox.ts`); the later import is not part of
 * the header and a JSDoc beside it is not this defect.
 *
 * # Scope boundary (v1), and it is a floor rather than a clean bill of health
 *
 * A docblock sitting immediately above the first declaration — no blank line
 * between them — is NOT reported, because at that position a module docblock
 * and an ordinary JSDoc for that declaration are textually identical and only a
 * reader can tell them apart. `schemas/zod-error.ts` documents its one export
 * from there and is correct; `release/exclude-parser-parity.test.ts` describes
 * the whole file from there and arguably is not. Reporting the position would
 * make the guard demand that every documented first export lose its JSDoc, so
 * the ambiguous case is deliberately left to judgment.
 *
 * Repair, when this goes red: move the reported docblock to line 1, above every
 * import. `eslint --fix` leaves it there; the sort has no reason to move a
 * comment that precedes the block it sorts.
 *
 * Maintainer-only by construction: `.gaia/cli/src` is release-excluded, so an
 * adopter clone carries neither these sources nor this test, and the suite skips
 * there. Mirrors `command-reachability.test.ts`.
