/**
 * Maintainer guard: a module docblock precedes the file's first import.
 *
 * A `/** … *\/` block placed *below* the first import no longer documents the
 * module. JSDoc binds by adjacency, so it attaches to whatever follows it,
 * usually the next `import` statement, and the file's primary explanation is
 * silently misattributed to a dependency.
 *
 * # Why this needs a guard rather than a sweep
 *
 * The class recreates itself out of ordinary editing, so fixing the instances
 * alone buys a diff that decays. Imports are sorted by specifier, and a
 * docblock written above what was then the first import is left behind the
 * moment an import that sorts higher is added. Nobody chooses this and nothing
 * reports it: 81 files had accumulated when `#1163` measured the class, against
 * a single instance (`#1034`) that had been fixed one-at-a-time on the
 * assumption it was unique.
 *
 * The convention is therefore asserted rather than merely swept: 126 files led
 * with their docblock deliberately, and every file that did not was an artifact
 * of the sort. `#1034` had already accepted the correctness argument.
 *
 * # What counts as an offense
 *
 * A `/**`-opening block comment inside the file's LEADING import block that is
 * followed by a blank line or by another import. Both are positions no author
 * picks for a declaration's JSDoc, so both indicate a module docblock that the
 * sort has stranded.
 *
 * The leading import block is the header region only: the run of import
 * declarations at the top of the file, as the TypeScript parser reads them,
 * ending at the first statement of any other kind. An import declaration is
 * `import … from`, a side-effect `import '…'`, `import type`, or
 * `import x = …` (a `require(…)` or a namespace alias) with or without
 * `export`; `import.meta` and a dynamic `import(…)` are expressions and close
 * the header like any other statement. Comments and blank lines are trivia to
 * the parser, so they never close it. A file may open with its docblock,
 * import, and then import again further down beside the code that needs it
 * (`setup-ci/__tests__/sandbox.ts`); the later import is not part of the header
 * and a JSDoc beside it is not this defect.
 *
 * # Why the header is read from the TypeScript AST
 *
 * Where a statement ends is a parser's question. A line scanner has to find
 * terminators and comment boundaries in raw text, and every comment or string
 * shape it does not model moves a boundary without a sound: a `;` inside a
 * comment ends an import early, a block comment left open across lines hides
 * one, and `import (` reads as a declaration. Stripping comments correctly also
 * needs string awareness, since `import x from 'https://cdn/x.js';` would lose
 * its specifier to a naive `//` strip, and that is a tokenizer. So the guard
 * uses the compiler's own: statements from `ts.createSourceFile`, and each
 * statement's comments from `ts.getLeadingCommentRanges`.
 *
 * `typescript` resolves here as this workspace's devDependency, which holds only
 * while the guard stays test-resident. Moving it into shipped CLI source would
 * need `typescript` in `dependencies`.
 *
 * # Scope boundary (v1), and it is a floor rather than a clean bill of health
 *
 * A docblock leading the first declaration, with no blank line between them, is
 * NOT reported, because at that position a module docblock and an ordinary
 * JSDoc for that declaration are textually identical and only a reader can tell
 * them apart. `schemas/zod-error.ts` documents its one export from there and is
 * correct; `release/exclude-parser-parity.test.ts` describes the whole file from
 * there and arguably is not. Reporting the position would make the guard demand
 * that every documented first export lose its JSDoc, so the ambiguous case is
 * deliberately left to judgment.
 *
 * Repair, when this goes red: move the reported docblock to line 1, above every
 * import. `eslint --fix` leaves it there; the sort has no reason to move a
 * comment that precedes the block it sorts.
 *
 * Maintainer-only by construction: `.gaia/cli/src` is release-excluded, so an
 * adopter clone carries neither these sources nor this test, and the suite skips
 * there. Mirrors `command-reachability.test.ts`.
