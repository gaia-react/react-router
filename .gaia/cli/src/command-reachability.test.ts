/**
 * Maintainer guards for the CLI subcommand surface. Two of them, sharing one
 * router scan: a reachability guard (is each command invoked from anywhere?)
 * and a help-summary completeness guard (is each command documented in its
 * binary's top-level summary?).
 *
 * # Reachability
 *
 * `knip` cannot see this class of deadness. A subcommand is statically
 * reachable through its router's `SUBCOMMAND_HANDLERS` object map, so
 * import-graph analysis always marks it live. The deadness lives one layer
 * lower, at runtime string dispatch: nothing ever passes the argv that
 * selects the command. `gaia update merge` sat dead ~18 days exactly this
 * way, the `/update-gaia` skill stopped routing it but the handler, its
 * help line, and its own test kept it import-reachable.
 *
 * This guard enumerates every `SUBCOMMAND_HANDLERS` leaf command across the
 * two binary entrypoints and the domain routers, then asserts each one is
 * reachable from at least one EXTERNAL invoker: an invocation-shaped string
 * (`gaia <path>` / `gaia-maintainer <path>`) in a skill, command, hook,
 * agent, CI workflow (committed or bundled template), or wiki page. The
 * binary may carry a path prefix and may be quoted, so a release-resolved
 * `"$LATEST_DIR/.gaia/cli/gaia" <path>` counts on its own; see
 * `matchesInvocation`. A command's own router (its help text) and its own
 * test are never in the haystack, so they cannot vouch for it. Commands that
 * are invoker-less by design or pending triage are listed in
 * `INTERNAL_COMMANDS` with a reason.
 *
 * Maintainer-only by construction: `.gaia/cli/src` is release-excluded, so
 * adopters carry neither these routers nor this test. On any clone where the
 * routers are absent the suite skips, mirroring the audit-template dogfood
 * guard.
 *
 * Scope boundary (v1): only `SUBCOMMAND_HANDLERS`-dispatched commands. The
 * `if (subcommand === '...')` routers (`scaffold`) use a different dispatch
 * shape and are out of scope. The oracle is a
 * substring match, so an invocation-shaped string in operator-facing prose
 * (e.g. a recovery hint in a CI PR body) counts as reachable; that is the
 * intended floor, the target is the command referenced by nothing at all.
 *
 * # Help-summary completeness
 *
 * Each binary prints a top-level summary with one line per command. A
 * namespace line's subcommands are also declared, separately, in that
 * namespace's own router in a different file, and nothing points from one to
 * the other: a subcommand added to a router and to that router's own
 * `HELP_TEXT`, both in the file the author already has open, does not reach the
 * summary. The class recurs on its own and is invisible to a reader who
 * consults only one of the two surfaces, so it needs a guard rather than a
 * sweep.
 *
 * The convention this asserts is **exhaustive enumeration with no allowlist**:
 * a namespace line names every key its router dispatches and nothing else.
 * `sandbox seed` is listed even though the reachability guard above records it
 * as invoker-less by design, which is the existing text's own answer to whether
 * a summary is a curated view (it is not). Should a command ever genuinely need
 * to be unlisted, design the allowlist then; speculating one now costs a second
 * hand-maintained list to keep honest.
 *
 * Scope boundary, narrower than the reachability guard's: only lines whose
 * first token is a `SUBCOMMAND_HANDLERS` domain router are compared key-for-key.
 * A top-level leaf that carries its own inner verbs (`ci-revert open|…`,
 * `harden-ledger list|…`) declares them inside a single handler rather than in
 * a router map, and `scaffold` dispatches with `if (subcommand === '...')`, so
 * for those lines this guard checks only that the command is documented and
 * dispatched, never that the verbs after it are complete.
