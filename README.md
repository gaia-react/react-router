## Is this associated with the GAIA Flash Framework?

**Yes!**

The GAIA Flash Framework revolutionized Flash website development and became the most popular Flash framework in the world (second only to Adobe Flex, which was focused on enterprise applications). It was used to build over 100,000 Flash sites and relied upon by every major digital agency worldwide.

GAIA React is its spiritual successor. It has been reborn as a React template. Like its predecessor, it's designed to be the most comprehensive and easy-to-use React template available, to build professional-grade frontend applications.

## Installation

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >=20.17.0 LTS installed, preferably via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

All you need to do is run this installation command and get to work.

```sh
npx create-react-router@latest --template gaia-react/react-router
```

### Install packages

```sh
npm install
```

Duplicate the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`.

### Setup Fix on Save in your IDE

Follow these [instructions](/docs/tech-stack/code-quality/#setup-fix-on-save).

## Development

Here's how to develop with GAIA.

### Storybook

```sh
npm run storybook
```

### React Router 7

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/) configured, with some configuration and utilities, which you can change to suit your project.

See the [Vite docs on css](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) for more information.

### Icons

[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is included. You're free to change it if you like.

### i18n

[Remix-i18next](https://github.com/sergiodxa/remix-i18next) is configured with examples.

Storybook is already configured with react-i18n support.

## Testing

GAIA comes with a full testing suite already configured.

### Unit and Integration

- [vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

```sh
  npm t
  // or
  npm run test
```

### Visual Regression

[Chromatic](https://chromatic.com)

You'll need to set your `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN` env variable on your CI.

### E2E

[PlayWright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro)

```sh
npx playwright test
```

Interactive mode:

```sh
npx playwright test --ui
```

## Deployment

GAIA comes with the default Remix deployment configuration. You can change this to whatever deployment process you prefer.

Here's the basic Remix deployment process:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

You'll need to pick a host to deploy it to. Jacob Paris wrote a [great article](https://www.jacobparis.com/content/where-to-host-remix) on where to host your React Router 7 app.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
