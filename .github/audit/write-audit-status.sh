# Write the terminal GAIA-Audit commit status for one sha.
#
# THE FAIL-CLOSED RULE THIS FILE OWNS: never post a status, pending or success,
# on a digest we could not recompute, and never overwrite a live success we
# cannot see. It used to exist in five independent copies across
# .github/workflows/code-review-audit.yml -- one per terminal path -- so a
# correction landed on one and silently left the others stale, and because each
# copy guards a path a given PR may never exercise, the divergence survived CI
# indefinitely and surfaced as one status meaning different things depending on
# which path produced it (gaia-react/gaia#1286). This script is the single copy.
#
# Usage:
#   write-audit-status.sh --sha <sha> --base <pr-base-sha> [--require-marker]
#   write-audit-status.sh --sha <sha> --force-pending <description>
#
# Two modes, because the call sites are two shapes and pretending
# otherwise would mean a flag that turns off half the script:
#
#   GATED (--base)          Resolve the co-dispatched members CI cannot clear.
#                           Any pending member means `pending`; none means
#                           `success`. Four call sites.
#   STAND-DOWN (--force-pending)
#                           Never post success; post the given description as
#                           `pending`. The local-mode stand-down, where CI runs
#                           no audit at all, so there is nothing to clear.
#
# Modifier, gated mode only. It qualifies the success path, which stand-down
# mode does not have, so passing it with --force-pending is refused rather than
# ignored:
#   --require-marker        Post nothing unless the frontend member's clean
#                           marker exists for the recomputed digest. The
#                           clean-no-push path's proven-clean check.
#
# Step outputs. When $GITHUB_OUTPUT is set this writes `members_pending`,
# `success_stamped`, `post_failed`, and, from the shared non-clobber read,
# `success_live` / `read_failed`, which the terminal comment steps read so they
# can never claim a stamp that did not happen. Callers with no `id:` simply have
# no one reading them.
#
# A REJECTED STATUS POST NEVER FAILS THE STEP, ON ANY PATH. The merge gate fails
# closed without help: nothing posted means the required GAIA-Audit context is
# absent, and an absent required check shuts the button exactly as a `pending`
# one does. So redding the job protects nothing, and it misattributes the
# failure -- the audit itself passed, and a red `code-review-audit` check says it
# did not. gaia-react/gaia#726 is the shape this prevents: an HTTP 422 on an
# unpushed sha turned an otherwise-clean audit red. Targeting the pushed head
# closed that particular 422, but a rate limit, a 5xx, or an auth blip rejects a
# POST the same way and is not closed by anything.
#
# The author's signal is `post_failed` instead, which the terminal comment steps
# report by name. That is the more diagnostic half of the trade: a red job buries
# its cause in a step log, and on the two skip paths it also SUPPRESSED the
# comment step, so the case most in need of an explanation produced none.
#
# `post_failed` covers BOTH posts, the success one and the pending one. It did
# not always: the pending POST swallowed its own rejection through a bare
# `|| true`, so on that path the comment steps read a non-empty `members_pending`
# and told the author the gate was pending when no pending status had been posted
# (gaia-react/gaia#1405). That was a wrong explanation rather than a wrong gate --
# it failed closed, and it self-healed once the dispatched members ran locally --
# but it is the same defect the ladders' SUCCESS_LIVE and READ_FAILED arms exist
# to prevent, so it gets the same answer.
#
# The two posts differ in what the author is then told, because IN GATED MODE a
# rejection on the PENDING path always co-occurs with a non-empty
# `members_pending`: that POST fires only under a non-empty `pending`, which
# gated mode has already published as `members_pending`. So the terminal ladders
# report the combined state in one sentence -- the members only a local run can
# clear, AND the rejection that means nothing was posted -- instead of picking
# one of the two facts.
#
# STAND-DOWN MODE IS THE EXCEPTION, and it is inert rather than handled. That
# mode never emits `members_pending` at all (there are no members to resolve),
# so a rejection there publishes `post_failed` beside an EMPTY one. No ladder
# ever sees that pair: the sole stand-down call site carries no `id:`, so
# nothing reads its outputs. The unqualified claim would be wrong; the gated
# qualification is what makes it true, and the missing `id:` is what makes the
# stand-down case harmless.
#
# Two suites cover this script: one drives it directly for its argument
# contract, and one executes every call site as the workflow runs them.

# that this file exists to remove, one level up. Same spelling the siblings use
# (gate-pending-members.sh, resolve-audit-base.sh).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 5. The pending POST, and the read that keeps it from clobbering a success.
#
# A GitHub commit status has NO compare-and-set: for a given context the newest
# write wins outright. CI runs the default member alone, so it cannot clear a
# co-dispatched specialized member and correctly declines to post success. But
# the LOCAL member-aware producer (.claude/hooks/post-audit-status.sh) posts
# `success` once EVERY dispatched member has cleared, and nothing sequences the
# two writers. An unconditional `pending` landing last overwrites a legitimate
# `success`: the required check reverts to pending, `gh pr merge` is rejected by
# branch protection, and nothing re-posts, so the gate stays shut until a human
# notices. Any PR whose dispatched set includes a member CI cannot run reaches
# this path, so it is a routine shape, not an edge case. The workflow also
# re-fires on labeled/unlabeled against the SAME head sha with no new push,
# which is how the local-mode stand-down hits it hardest.
#
# So: skip the pending POST when a GAIA-Audit `success` is already the LIVE
# status on this sha AND carries THIS EXACT FRONTEND DIGEST. Such a success
# means every dispatched member has already cleared this content. A success
# naming a DIFFERENT digest is correctly ignored (the digest is the marker's
# identity), and a sha nobody has cleared has no such success, so this fails
# closed in every direction.
#
# Residual race, deliberately accepted: if the local POST lands between this
# read and the write below, `pending` still wins and the gate stays shut until
# the producer is re-run. Sub-second, and it fails CLOSED.
#
# audit-success-present.sh owns the read: 0 = a success for this digest IS live,
# 1 = definitively not, 2 = could NOT ask. TEST FOR A DEFINITIVE 1, never for
# "not 0 and not 2". The exit space is OPEN -- 127 when the file is absent or
# unreadable, a signal death, some code a future version adds -- and each of
# those is MORE unanswerable than a 2, not less. Enumerating the stand-down
# codes lets every unenumerated one fall through to the POST, silently restoring
# the clobber on exactly the runs where the guard is broken. Inverting the test
# makes the stand-down the default and the POST the exception. Standing down
# still fails CLOSED: an absent required check blocks the merge just as a
# pending one does.

  # a status that was never posted. The gate is shut either way, so this is a
  # wrong explanation rather than a wrong gate -- and a wrong explanation is
  # exactly what the SUCCESS_LIVE and READ_FAILED arms of those ladders already
  # exist to prevent, on claims those paths merely could not verify. This one is
  # known false, so the same rule applies with more force.
  #
  # IN GATED MODE it always co-occurs with a non-empty `members_pending`: this
  # branch runs only under a non-empty `pending`, and gated mode emitted
  # `members_pending` from that same value. So the ladders combine the two rather
  # than choosing between them, and hoisting their post_failed arm above
  # members_pending would discard the half only a LOCAL member run can act on.
  #
  # In STAND-DOWN mode `pending` is the forced description and `members_pending`
  # was never emitted, so this `post_failed` would stand alone. Nothing reads it:
  # that call site carries no `id:`. The emit is published either way rather than
  # gated on the mode, because a conditional emit would be a second rule to keep
  # in step with the one `id:` that decides whether anyone is listening.
