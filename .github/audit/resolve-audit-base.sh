# resolve-audit-base.sh: resolve the incremental review base for the
# code-review-audit agent.
#
# Purpose
#   The audit reviews the diff from a "base" commit to HEAD. The base is
#   the most recent ancestor of HEAD that previously passed a CLEAN audit
#   under the CURRENT agent version, proven by either a GAIA-Audit commit
#   trailer (locally-stamped) or a GAIA-Audit commit status (CI-stamped).
#   Everything up to that commit was already cleared, so reviewing only
#   <base>..HEAD is correct and far cheaper than re-reviewing the whole
#   origin/main..HEAD diff on every push to an open PR.
#
#   That whole-team signal is stamped only when NO dispatched Code Audit
#   Team member is still pending, which is what makes it trustworthy and
#   also what caps it: a member that cleared in a round where a sibling was
#   pending cannot anchor on its own clearance. Naming a member with
#   `--member` adds a second anchor arm over the same walk, reading that
#   member's own earned clearances out of the local audit store. The
#   whole-team signal stays the FLOOR; the per-member arm only ever improves
#   on it, never replaces it.
#
#   When no usable ancestor exists, first audit of a PR, every prior run
#   cancelled or failed (those stamp nothing), a .gaia/VERSION bump
#   invalidated older audits, or the version file is missing; the helper
#   emits the main ref so the caller falls back to a full-scope review. It
#   can never skip uncleared code: an uncleared commit carries no signal to
#   anchor on.
#
# Invocation
#   .github/audit/resolve-audit-base.sh [--member <name>]
#
#   The argument-less form is what every non-agent caller uses (the audit
#   workflow and the workflow templates), and its resolution is unchanged on
#   every input except the inverted degraded arm below. The merge-time
#   findings hook is not one of them and no longer calls this script at all:
#   the block it posts selects its sidecars on the branch, across every base. `--member <name>` is the per-member form; the Code Audit Team's
#   agent definitions are the only call sites that can name a member.
#
#   Reads .gaia/VERSION, HEAD's ancestry, commit trailers, the local audit
#   store's clearance records, and (when GH_TOKEN + gh are available) the
#   GitHub Commit Status API.
#
# Output (stdout), argument-less form
#   Exactly ONE line, suitable for a `base...HEAD` diff:
#     <40-hex-sha>: resolved incremental base (an audited PR ancestor)
#     origin/<base-ref>: fallback: review the full PR diff, scoped to the
#       branch the PR merges into (GITHUB_BASE_REF, read under Actions only,
#       which sets it on every pull_request event)
#     origin/main: the same fallback outside Actions, or when no base ref is
#       declared
#     (or main when neither remote-tracking ref resolves)
#
# Output (stdout), --member form
#   Exactly FOUR newline-terminated lines:
#     1. the per-member review base ref, which SCOPES that member's review
#     2. the reason token (closed set, below)
#     3. the shared pull-request-wide base ref, which KEYS every artifact
#     4. the recorded tree of the clearance that anchored line 1, or EMPTY
#        on every path where no clearance anchored it
#
#   Line 3 comes from the same code path the argument-less form prints, so
#   co-dispatched members agree on the key structurally rather than
#   incidentally: each receives byte-identically what the argument-less form
#   carries, which is what makes the shared re-run ledger one file per round.
#   The findings block used to be the second beneficiary of that agreement and
#   is no longer a beneficiary at all; the ledger is the whole reason line 3
#   exists. Lines 1 and 3
#   legitimately differ, e.g. when a merely-shared machinery path changed
#   after the anchor: line 3 resets and line 1 does not. That divergence is
#   what the two-base split is for.
#
#   Line 4 lets a caller record WHICH clearance anchored the answer without
#   a second invocation and without parsing stderr. An empty line 4 is the
#   normal case for every reason other than member-clearance, and an empty
#   line is still a line.
#
# Output (stderr)
#   Exactly one decision line on every path:
#     resolve-audit-base: member=<name|-> base=<sha|ref> reason=<token> anchor_tree=<tree|->
#   plus one FURTHER explanatory line when a reset or a degradation fired,
#   naming the path or the library that forced it. Closed reason set:
#     member-clearance    anchored on this member's own earned clearance
#     team-signal         anchored on the whole-team trailer/status floor
#     no-anchor           no usable anchor in range; full scope
#     rules-reset-global  a global-rules path changed between anchor and HEAD
#     rules-reset-member  this member's own agent definition changed
#     machinery-reset     the argument-less flat machinery reset fired
#     degraded            classifier, machinery, rules, or version lib not
#                         sourceable
#     no-version          .gaia/VERSION missing or empty
#
# Exit code
#   0 always, on every path, a usage error included. A non-zero exit does
#   NOT degrade the callers uniformly to full scope: it degrades the agent
#   call sites to an EMPTY review scope, because an empty base makes git
#   resolve the diff's left side to HEAD and return nothing at status 0.
#   Reviewing nothing is worse than reviewing everything. The merge-time
#   findings hook is no longer among the degraded callers: it does not call
#   this script, so a non-zero exit here costs it nothing and it still posts. This script runs under
#   `set -euo pipefail`, so every library function is probed with
#   `command -v` before it is called: an unguarded call into a library that
#   did not load is a command-not-found, which is exactly that non-zero
#   exit.
#
# Why version-match (not digest-match) gates a base
#   A commit is a usable base when its audit signal's <version> equals the
#   current .gaia/VERSION. A version mismatch means the ruleset changed
#   since that audit, so code cleared under the old version may now have
#   findings; that commit is NOT a safe base, and the walk continues,
#   ultimately falling back to a full re-audit under the new ruleset. The
#   signal's frontend-digest and tree fields are not compared here; they
#   describe content the audit already reviewed, not whether the ruleset
#   that reviewed it is still current. The per-member arm is gated the same
#   way, on the clearance body's own recorded version.
#
# Base reset on machinery change (RT-006)
#   A version-matching candidate is not automatically safe: if any
#   gate-machinery file (the ownership classifier, the machinery matcher,
#   the digest recipe itself) changed between that candidate and HEAD, the
#   candidate's audit ran under different membership/scoping rules than
#   HEAD's, even though the version string didn't move. Reviewing only
#   <candidate>..HEAD would then leave the candidate's own pre-base content
#   unreviewed under the new rules. The argument-less form keeps that one
#   flat test over the whole machinery set (via the batch machinery matcher,
#   sourced from the checkout), so its resolution stays what it has always
#   been.
#
# The two-tier reset, --member form only
#   The flat test is far broader than the question a single member is
#   asking. A repair to one member's own lens file, or an edit to a hook
#   that only posts a status, resets every member. So the per-member form
#   tests the same delta in two tiers (audit-rules-changed.sh):
#     global tier  the files deciding what a member owns, what counts as
#                  machinery, how a digest is computed, whether a clearance
#                  is believed, which members are dispatched, or under which
#                  version any of that was decided. Resets EVERY member.
#     member tier  a member's own agent definition. Resets only that member.
#   Machinery that is merely shared resets nobody. It still rotates digests,
#   so a fresh clearance is still required before the merge gate opens, but
#   the review earning it stays incremental. The tier predicate is a
#   carve-out of the machinery set and never edits it.
#
# Per-member anchor: what a clearance proves, and what it does not
#   A candidate is a per-member anchor when the member holds an earned
#   clearance whose recorded TREE equals the candidate's tree and whose
#   recorded version equals the current one. The tree rather than the commit
#   sha is the matching field because the clean-round stamp amends HEAD,
#   rewriting the sha a moments-old clearance recorded while preserving the
#   tree; matching on the sha would lose the anchor on exactly the rounds
#   that earned it. No member digest is ever recomputed at a candidate: the
#   ownership classifier reads the working tree's roster rather than the
#   candidate commit's, so a recomputed digest can name a value that never
#   existed at that commit.
#
#   CHAINED TRUST, a documented assumption rather than a proof. A clearance
#   body records the member, the digest, the version, the write-time HEAD
#   commit, and the tree, but never the RANGE the member reviewed. So a
#   clearance at commit C attests a content digest over that member's owned
#   files at C; that it covers everything up to C holds only by chaining,
#   each clearance inheriting the coverage of the ones before it. A single
#   vacuous clearance would therefore propagate forward invisibly. The
#   clearance validity predicate this arm leans on is likewise a
#   well-formedness and change-detection key, NOT an anti-forgery defence:
#   anyone who can write the store can already write the working tree.
#   Repairing either property is a human's decision, not this file's.
#
# Refusal precedence, and why the floor still runs past a refusal
#   If any candidate in range carries a tree the member REFUSED, the
#   per-member arm is disabled for the whole run, not merely at that
#   candidate: the member must be able neither to anchor on content it
#   refused nor to anchor past it, and the walk meets a newer earned
#   clearance first. The whole-team floor is deliberately NOT disabled by a
#   refusal. The trailer and the status are each stamped only when no
#   dispatched member is pending, and a member holding a live refusal IS
#   pending, so a whole-team signal at or newer than the refused commit is
#   evidence that the refusal was already resolved (superseded by its author
#   or retired by a digest rotation). That reasoning inherits the stamping
#   hook's member-pending check, which sits inside a guard with no else arm
#   and stamps anyway in a degraded environment; the floor is therefore
#   sound in the normal case and fail-open in a degraded one.
#
# Fail direction: an unloadable library resets to full scope
#   With the classifier, the machinery matcher, or the rules-tier predicate
#   unsourceable, NEITHER tier can be evaluated, so the anchor's soundness
#   for the resolving member cannot be established at all and the narrowing
#   it would permit is member-specific and invisible. Both forms therefore
#   emit the full-scope main ref and log the degradation; on no path is a
#   candidate emitted. The merge gate already denies outright on the same
#   input, so this agrees with the gate rather than adding a new denial. The
#   accepted cost is that a checkout missing those libraries always reviews
#   full scope.
#
#   audit-clearance.sh is the deliberate exception. Its absence is the same
#   condition as an empty clearance store, which is every
#   continuous-integration run: the store is gitignored and never uploaded
#   between runs. There the floor is sound and both tiers stay evaluable, so
#   resolution falls back to the whole-team signal rather than degrading.
#   Widening to full scope on that input would punish the normal CI path for
#   a broken-checkout symptom. Do not "fix" this into uniformity.
#
# Why bound the walk to merge-base..HEAD
#   The base must be one of THIS PR's commits (or the divergence point as
#   the floor). Walking into main's own history could pick a deeper main
#   commit and pull already-merged, unrelated changes into this PR's review
#   scope. The merge-base bound prevents that; reaching the floor yields the
#   main ref, i.e. the same scope as origin/main...HEAD.
#
# Conventions
#   - Bash 3.2 compatible (macOS default). No associative arrays / mapfile.
#   - Never `cd`s (per .claude/rules/shell-cwd.md). Uses git -C "$repo_root".
#   - Mirrors the frozen trailer regex + status-parse logic in
#     .github/audit/check-trailer.sh.

  # The member tier's trigger is the whole file: any change to
  # .claude/agents/<member>.md re-arms this reset, a reworded sentence as
  # readily as a rewritten remit, and the member then re-reviews the whole
  # pull request's diff against its remit instead of the delta since its
  # anchor. That breadth is chosen, and it is the expensive choice: a round of
  # prose repairs spanning several definitions pays that widened re-review for
  # every member it touches.
  #
  # It is chosen because a member definition is an instruction file, where the
  # prose IS the logic and no syntactic split separates a comment-only edit
  # from a behavior-changing one. "Prefer" becoming "always" inside a remit
  # rewrites what the member looks for, and only the surrounding sentence says
  # so. The narrowings that look attractive fail on their own terms. Resetting
  # only outside regions marked non-normative has no region to key on: the
  # gaia:maintainer-only markers mark AUDIENCE, a maintainer-only paragraph
  # still instructs, and most member definitions carry no marker at all, so a
  # new convention would rest the reset on whoever remembered to mark a
  # region. Exempting a member's own round-trip repair is backwards, because
  # the member reviewed under the OLD definition and its correction is what
  # changes the instructions it runs under next.
  #
  # The direction of the miss settles it. Resetting too often costs tokens and
  # wall-clock, and both are visible in the run that pays them. Resetting too
  # rarely lets a member earn a clearance marker over a surface narrower than
  # its changed instructions warrant, and the merge gate believes the marker
  # rather than re-deriving the scope behind it, so nothing downstream catches
  # that one.
  #
  # What stays open is the number of resets rather than the trigger: batching
  # a round's definition repairs into one commit pays one reset, not one per
  # commit.
