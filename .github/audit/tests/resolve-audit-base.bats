# Tests for .github/audit/resolve-audit-base.sh.
#
# The helper is consumed by the code-review-audit CI workflow's "Resolve
# audit base" step, by the merge-time findings hook, and by the Code Audit
# Team's agent definitions on local runs. Two invocation forms:
#
#   argument-less   ONE stdout line: the most recent PR ancestor of HEAD that
#                   passed a clean whole-team audit under the current
#                   .gaia/VERSION (proven by a GAIA-Audit commit trailer or
#                   commit status), or the main ref for a full-scope fallback.
#   --member <name> FOUR stdout lines: the per-member review base, the reason
#                   token, the shared pull-request-wide base (byte-identical
#                   to what the argument-less form prints on the same
#                   fixture), and the recorded tree of the clearance that
#                   anchored the answer.
#
# The base is gated by VERSION MATCH ALONE on both anchor arms: the
# trailer/status shared with check-trailer.sh is the three-field C3 form
# ("<version> <frontend-digest> <tree>"), of which only the version (field 1)
# is read here, and a per-member clearance is usable only when its recorded
# version equals the current one. Once an anchor is found, the delta between
# it and HEAD decides whether it survives: the argument-less form applies the
# flat machinery test (RT-006), the --member form applies the two-tier rules
# test (global rules reset every member, a member's own agent definition
# resets only that member, merely-shared machinery resets nobody).
#
# Each test runs the script in an isolated `git init`'d temp dir whose HEAD
# sits on a FEATURE branch off `main`, so the merge-base bound leaves the
# branch's own commits walkable (committing straight on main would make
# merge-base == HEAD and the candidate list empty). The four predicate libs
# are provisioned on disk (not committed -- the resolver only needs them
# loadable, never as digest input); their absence now DECIDES the answer, so
# dedicated tests remove them one at a time.
#
# The commit-status path is exercised by mocking `gh` on a prepended PATH
# (see install_gh_mock), keyed by commit SHA so a multi-commit walk can
# return different statuses per commit.
#
# Reason-token reachability lives in its own section at the foot of the file:
# one test per token in the closed set of eight.
