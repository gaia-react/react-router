# ledger-update.sh: Merge a JSON object into the .gaia/local/specs/ledger.json row
# matching spec_id. Existing fields are overwritten; absent fields are preserved.

# Usage:
#   ledger-update.sh <repo_root> <spec_id> '<json-object>'
#
# Refuses if the row is missing, callers must allocate via spec-allocator.sh first.
#
# The jq…>tmp; mv critical section runs inside the shared ledger mutex
# (with-ledger-lock.sh) so it serializes against spec-allocator.sh's row
# append on the same .gaia/local/specs/ledger.json. See with-ledger-lock.sh for
# the lock env knobs (GAIA_LEDGER_LOCK_*).
#
# Exit codes: 0 ok, 2 usage, 4 ledger or row missing OR lock-acquisition
# timeout OR the shared mutex library unusable (could not safely apply the
# ledger write), 5 invalid patch JSON, 6 non-canonical status value in the
# patch.

# off-vocabulary rows (e.g. a hand-edited "shipped") are repaired by
