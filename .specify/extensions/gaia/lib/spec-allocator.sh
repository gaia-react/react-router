# spec-allocator.sh: Allocate SPEC-NNN ids using the .gaia/local/specs/ledger.json
# ledger, self-healed against deterministic markers in git (spec-NNN-* branches) and
# the working-tree SPEC files. The repo must be a git working tree.
#
# Usage:
#   spec-allocator.sh next <repo_root> [<subject>]  # print next SPEC-NNN, reserve on remote, write ledger row
#   spec-allocator.sh highest <repo_root>           # print highest known SPEC-NNN, or "none"
#   spec-allocator.sh in_progress <repo_root>       # print first unfinalized (draft) SPEC id, or "none"
#   spec-allocator.sh reserve_pending <repo_root>   # push deferred provisional reservations; fail-open, exit 0
#
# Authority: the remote's spec/* tag namespace is the cross-team allocation
# authority; the local, gitignored .gaia/local/specs/ledger.json is a per-machine
# cache of draft status, intent, and timestamps, and one input to the union `next`
# reads. `next` performs a self-heal pass before allocating, any SPEC id found in a
# branch name (the deterministic marker that GAIA tooling creates) is treated as
# burned even if missing from the ledger. A skipped slot is strictly cheaper than a
# duplicate id. Commit messages are NOT scanned; they pick up free-text references
# (test fixtures, regression notes) that would inflate the highest id incorrectly.
#
# Reservation: `next` computes max+1 over the UNION of the remote spec/* tags (when
# reachable) and the local signals, then reserves the number by a non-force push of
# an immutable `spec/NNN` annotated tag pointed at git's empty-tree object
# (4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904). The push IS the cross-machine lock: a
# remote grants each ref once, so a rejected push whose ref now exists means another
# machine took the number → re-read the union and retry at the next number, bounded.
# The tag name is zero-padded to three digits (spec/021) so the namespace stays
# uniform; the union parser strips leading zeros so a legacy spec/22 still parses.
# Reservation tags are immutable: created once, never force-updated, never deleted
# on the remote (a failed LOCAL tag may be deleted before retrying at a free number).
# Each row records a `reservation` state:
#   reserved     — tag confirmed pushed to the remote.
#   provisional  — remote unreachable at allocation; deferred push pending (reserve_pending).
#   local        — no origin remote configured; local-only numbering, no push ever needed.
#   unavailable  — remote reachable but tag namespace not writable; degraded with a warning.
# and a `subject` (first line of the <subject> arg, trimmed, <=100 chars, non-empty;
# falls back to the SPEC id) used verbatim as the tag annotation, set once at
# reservation and never updated on a later push. Rows lacking reservation/subject are
# tolerated everywhere (a missing reservation is terminal, never auto-pushed).
#
# Never blocks or hangs: the remote read/push are bounded by a portable
# background-kill watchdog (the target machine has no timeout/gtimeout) plus
# GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 so a credential prompt cannot stall /gaia-spec. With no
# reachable remote allocation records a provisional local-union max+1 and reserves
# later; if that deferred push loses a race the in-flight spec is renumbered to the
# next free number via spec-renumber.sh rather than keeping the collided number.
#
# Concurrency: the `next` read-union-reserve-write critical section runs under the
# shared ledger mutex from with-ledger-lock.sh (flock when present, atomic-mkdir
# fallback on stock macOS). The remote read/push and ledger append happen inside the
# single held mutex so two same-machine `next` calls cannot interleave. A lock-
# acquisition timeout (helper exit 75) maps to exit 4; reservation-retry exhaustion
# also maps to exit 4; callers (the speckit preset) already handle 4 as "allocation
# failed". Lock env knobs (GAIA_LEDGER_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECS / _STALE_SECS / _POLL_SECS /
# _FORCE_FALLBACK): see with-ledger-lock.sh. Reservation env knobs:
#   GAIA_SPEC_REMOTE_TIMEOUT_SECS  per ls-remote / push bound (default 5)
#   GAIA_SPEC_ALLOC_MAX_RETRIES    reservation retry bound     (default 5)
#   GAIA_SPEC_FORCE_OFFLINE=1       force the unreachable path  (test knob)
# `highest` and `in_progress` are read-only, take NO lock, and never touch the network.
