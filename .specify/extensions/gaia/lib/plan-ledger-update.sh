# plan-ledger-update.sh: Merge a JSON object into the .gaia/local/plans/ledger.json
# row matching plan_id. Existing fields are overwritten; absent fields are
# preserved. The plans-side mirror of ledger-update.sh (specs ledger).
#
# Usage:
#   plan-ledger-update.sh <repo_root> <plan_id> '<json-object>'
#
# Refuses if the row is missing, callers must allocate via plan-allocator.sh
# first. Initial status:"ready" is written inline by plan-allocator.sh at
# row creation (NOT via this chokepoint); every later transition goes through
# here.
#
# The jq…>tmp; mv critical section runs inside the PLAN-only ledger mutex
# (with-ledger-lock.sh, scoped to .gaia/local/plans) so it serializes against
# plan-allocator.sh's row append on the same ledger.json, without queuing
# behind the shared .gaia/local/specs lock a spec allocation can hold across
# network ops. See with-ledger-lock.sh for the lock env knobs
# (GAIA_LEDGER_LOCK_*).
#
# Canonical status vocabulary: ready | merged | abandoned. `abandoned` is
# reserved: the guard accepts it, but no shipped code path stamps it, there is
# no auto-abandon sweep, because a gitignored local-only ledger has no
# reliable stale-plan signal. The plans `status` field is distinct in meaning
# from the pre-existing `source` field (which reads "allocated" but records
# provenance, not lifecycle); this chokepoint never touches `source`.
#
# Exit codes: 0 ok, 2 usage, 4 ledger or row missing OR lock-acquisition
# timeout (could not safely apply the ledger write), 5 invalid patch JSON,
# 6 non-canonical status value in the patch.
