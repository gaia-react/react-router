# spec-folderize.sh: Migrate flat SPEC artifacts into per-SPEC folders.
#
# A SPEC artifact lives at .gaia/local/specs/<spec_id>/SPEC.md (and, when
# archived, .gaia/local/specs/archived/<spec_id>/SPEC.md). This script moves
# any legacy flat .gaia/local/specs/SPEC-NNN.md (and archived/SPEC-NNN.md)
# into that folder shape. The folder is the archival unit; moving it carries
# all sibling artifacts (REPORT.md, evidence) with it.
#
# Usage:
#   spec-folderize.sh [--dry-run] [<repo_root>]
#
#   <repo_root>   any directory inside the repository; defaults to the
#                 process working directory. Either way the SPEC directory
#                 migrated is always the main checkout's (.gaia/scripts/
#                 ledger-path-lib.sh resolves it), since the state registry
#                 declares specs/ main-only.
#   --dry-run     print the planned moves to stdout, change nothing
#
# Behavior:
#   - Each flat canonical file SPEC-NNN.md is moved to SPEC-NNN/SPEC.md.
#   - Each flat sibling file SPEC-NNN-<rest>.md is moved to SPEC-NNN/<REST>.md,
#     where <REST> is the remainder uppercased, hyphens kept. Any SPEC-NNN-*
#     file is a sibling; no suffix allowlist.
#     Examples: SPEC-NNN-REPORT.md          → SPEC-NNN/REPORT.md
#               SPEC-NNN-FOLLOWUP-REPORT.md → SPEC-NNN/FOLLOWUP-REPORT.md
#               SPEC-NNN-revised-contracts.md → SPEC-NNN/REVISED-CONTRACTS.md
#   - `.gaia/local/specs/` and `.gaia/local/specs/archived/` are both scanned.
#   - Tracked files (git ls-files --error-unmatch) move with `git mv`;
#     untracked files (the common adopter case; specs are gitignored) move
#     with plain `mv`.
#   - Idempotent: a file already at its target path is skipped. Running twice
#     is a no-op. Contents are moved byte-for-byte; no frontmatter edits.
#   - Stdout carries only the dry-run plan; all diagnostics go to stderr.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  ok, or no-op (already foldered / nothing to migrate / --dry-run)
#   2  usage error
#   3  repo root not resolvable
#   4  migration conflict (a flat file and its foldered counterpart both exist
#      for the same path; never guess, never overwrite)
#
# macOS-first: no GNU coreutils assumptions.
