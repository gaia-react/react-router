# plan-allocator.sh: Allocate PLAN-NNN ids for spec-less one-off plans using
# the .gaia/local/plans/ledger.json ledger. Local-only: no git requirement, no
# remote tag reservation, no network. Plans are gitignored and ephemeral, so
# the ledger alone (plus on-disk folders) is the collision authority. Next id
# is max+1 over the union of ledger ids and on-disk PLAN-NNN folders (both
# live and archived/).
#
# Usage:
#   plan-allocator.sh next <repo_root> [<subject>]  # print next PLAN-NNN, append ledger row
#
# Ledger rows are {id, allocated_at, source, subject, status}. status is
# written "ready" inline here at row creation; every later transition
# goes through the guarded plan-ledger-update.sh chokepoint. Numbers are
# never reused.
#
# Concurrency: the read-union-allocate-write critical section runs under the
# shared ledger mutex from with-ledger-lock.sh (flock when present, atomic-
# mkdir fallback on stock macOS), scoped to the PLAN-only lock dir
# (.gaia/local/plans), NOT the shared .gaia/local/specs lock a spec allocation
# can hold across network ops. A lock-acquisition timeout (helper exit 75)
# maps to exit 4.
