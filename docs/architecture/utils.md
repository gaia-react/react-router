# Utils

This folder contains utility functions and helpers that are used throughout the application. These utilities help streamline common tasks, improve code readability, and promote reusability across different components and modules.

The utilities should be well-named, self-explanatory, and have unit tests (whenever possible).

## tests

This folder contains unit tests for the utility functions defined in this directory. Generally speaking, utility functions should have corresponding test cases to ensure reliability and prevent bugs in case they're modified.

Some utility functions are so simple or implement native functionality such that tests may not be necessary. Use your judgment to determine when tests are needed.
