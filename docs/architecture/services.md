# Services

This `services` folder is where API calls and business logic are handled.

## `api`

The `api` folder contains GAIA's wrapper around the [Ky](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky) library.

Coming soon...

## `gaia`

The `gaia` folder is an example of how to organize services for a specific domain. You will replace this with your company's name, or a 3rd party API name, etc.

Coming soon...
