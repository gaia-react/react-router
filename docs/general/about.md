## Background

GAIA React is the spiritual successor to the GAIA Flash Framework, which was the most popular Flash framework in the world. It was used to build over 100,000 Flash sites and relied upon by every major digital agency worldwide. GAIA was known for its comprehensive feature set, ease of use, and robustness. It was designed to make Flash development easier and more efficient, and it succeeded in that goal.

GAIA React has been in development for over 4 years, with multiple developers on different teams contributing to its development. It has been used in production on multiple projects, and has been refined and improved over time.

## Why GAIA?

Back in the Flash days, almost all projects were greenfield, and Flash engineers had many opportunities every year to build projects from scratch. This gave us a lot of practice learning the hard way what worked and what didn't. We didn't have npm, we had to build everything ourselves everytime. And we got to do it over and over again.

Nowadays, there are few opportunities for engineers to practice and learn from building greenfield projects. Most projects are maintenance projects, where you're working on someone else's code, and your ability to make fundamental changes can be limited. In the worst cases, the main thing you're learning is how to cope with a project that has too much tech debt.

GAIA React is the culmination of years of experience building greenfield projects. It is a solid foundation for how a modern React project should be structured, organized, and sufficiently reinforced with linting and tests to ensure bugs and technical debt are kept to a minimum.

## Philosophy

GAIA is built upon the philosophy that the best way to produce cohesive well-written, easy-to-read and easy-to-maintain code, regardless of skill level, is having automated tooling to maintain code quality. GAIA's robust linting setup has fix-on-save functionality that automatically keeps code clean and high quality so you and your fellow developers can focus on what really matters.

All the linting configuration files are included. You can leave it as-is, or customize to your preferences. Detailed information about the linting setup can be found in the [Code Quality](/tech-stack/code-quality/) section.

## Component-Driven Development

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is included with GAIA to facilitate [Component-Driven Development](https://www.componentdriven.org/) which is a proven methodology for building web applications. It involves breaking down the UI into small, reusable components that can be developed, tested, and documented in isolation. This makes it easier to build, maintain, and scale applications.
