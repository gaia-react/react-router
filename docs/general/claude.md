# Claude Integration

GAIA comes with [Claude](https://claude.ai/) support built-in.

The following custom commands are included:

- `/gaia-init`: Initializes a new GAIA project by removing example code and setting up the project based on your preferences (e.g., project name, languages). This command should be run only once at the start of your project.
- `/update-react-router` - Updates React Router to the latest version and migrates your code, if necessary.
