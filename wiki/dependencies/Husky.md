# Husky + lint-staged

Pre-commit hooks. Configured by `npm run prepare` (skipped in CI via `is-ci`).

`.lintstagedrc` runs `typecheck`, `lint`, and `vitest --run --changed --bail 1` against staged files.

> [!key-insight] Tests on commit, not just lint
> GAIA runs **`vitest --run --changed`** in lint-staged. Most setups skip this because it's slow; GAIA accepts the cost because it catches regressions before they reach CI.
