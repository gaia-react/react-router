# Components

`app/components/` holds shared UI components. Page-specific UI lives in `app/pages/` (see [[Pages]]).

## Component folder convention (ESLint-enforced)

Each component lives in `app/components/{PascalName}/`:

- `index.tsx` — main component
- `styles.module.css` — CSS module styles (when needed)
- `types.ts` — types (when needed)
- `utils.ts` — utility functions (when needed)
- `assets/` — component-specific assets
- `hooks/` — component-specific hooks
- `state/` — component-specific Context/Provider
- `tests/` — Vitest tests + Storybook stories

> [!key-insight] Co-location with a `tests/` folder
> Co-locating everything next to the component keeps things discoverable, but flat sibling files get messy. The dedicated `tests/` folder (for stories + tests) restored the tidiness without sacrificing co-location. Same pattern extends to `assets/`, `hooks/`, `state/`. ESLint enforces this.

## Lifting components

> [!quote]
> "Lift" a child component only up to its highest level where it is shared.

Not strict, but a strong default. Refactoring is easier when the folder hierarchy mirrors actual usage.

## Bundled components

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AppVersion` | Display app version |
| `Button`, `LinkButton` | Primary action elements |
| `Document` | HTML document root (used by `root.tsx`) |
| `Errors/` | `RootErrorBoundary` and friends |
| `ExampleConsumer` | Example state-consumer (deleted by `/gaia-init`) |
| `Footer`, `Header`, `Layout` | Page chrome |
| `Form/` | The headline feature — see [[Form Components]] |
| `LanguageSelect` | Language switcher tied to `actions+/set-language` |
| `Loaders/` | Loading spinners and placeholders |
| `ThemeSwitcher` | Light/dark switcher tied to `actions+/set-theme` |
| `Toast` | Wrapper around `sonner` + `remix-toast` |

## Naming conventions

- PascalCase folder names
- `index.tsx` for the main file (configurable in ESLint if you prefer `ComponentName.tsx`)

See [[Component Testing]] for the `composeStory` test pattern.
