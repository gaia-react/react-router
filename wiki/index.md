# Index

Master catalog of every page in the wiki. Newly created pages must be added here.

> **Domain isolation:** Technical work fetches from `wiki/modules/`, `wiki/concepts/`, `wiki/decisions/`, `wiki/components/`, `wiki/flows/`, `wiki/dependencies/`. Only pull from other domains when the task genuinely spans both.

## Top-level

## Decisions (ADRs)

- [[No Component Library]]
- [[TypeScript Language Files]]
- [[TypeScript 7 Readiness]]: tsconfig pre-adopts the TS7 strict baseline; the 7.1 upgrade is a dep swap gated on typescript-eslint's programmatic API.
- [[Thin Routes]]
- [[Co-located Tests Folder]]
- [[composeStory Pattern]]
- [[Dark Mode Modernization]]
- [[Content Security Policy]]: per-request nonce CSP; Report-Only pending an upstream React Router fix; documents the `unsafe-inline` and no-`report-uri` trade-offs.
- [[Dispatched-Check Rollup via Polling]]: in-loop pollers stamp dispatched-workflow jobs via the Checks API so they land in `statusCheckRollup`; documents why a `workflow_run` listener is not viable under `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- [[Composite Action Step Timeouts]]: every `gaia-setup-node` call site carries its own `timeout-minutes`, strictly under its job's cap, so a stalled install reds by step name rather than by a generic job timeout; enforced by `audit-ci-shards.bats` W12 across every workflow.
- [[Code Audit Team]]: config-driven auditor roster + dispatch resolver; AND-aggregation across dispatched members at the merge gate; maintainer-only shell/node members.
- [[Deliberate Configuration Asymmetries]]: config that differs from its siblings on purpose; the `.claude/hooks/` Edit carve-out, the skill `model:` pinning criterion, the non-opt-outable update check, and the seeded agent-teams flag.
<!-- gaia:maintainer-only:start -->
- [[CLI-Binary-Split]]
- [[Folding Shell Scripts into the CLI Binary]]: considered and declined; the manifest is a never-merged sentinel and the fold is a delete, so it cannot deliver simpler diffs.
- [[Forensics Triage Workflow]]
- [[Sharded CI Test Matrix]]: `Audit CI Tests` as an 11-leg fan-out plus a thin aggregator; the zero-headroom 2-hop cap arithmetic any restructuring hits first, how to measure this workflow without the two traps, and the levers already weighed.
- [[Shell Guard Fixture Discrimination]]: fixture-region discrimination plus a suppression pragma so the shell guards can read `*.bats` without flagging their own suites' deliberately broken fixtures.
<!-- gaia:maintainer-only:end -->
- [[Quality Gate]]
- [[pnpm]]
- [[DragonScale Opt-Out]]
- [[spec-kit Extension Strategy]]
- [[Wiki Management]]: wiki primitives, state file, deterministic classification
- [[Claude Integration Fitness]]: check taxonomy + F-to-A+ grading + triage/heal protocol run by `/gaia-fitness`.
- [[TDD RED Verification]]: mechanical enforcement that a new test was observed failing before commit; RED-observation ledger + two hooks.
- [[Determinism Classifier]]: per-file AST signal labelling a source file strict (RED-gated) or emergent (advisory audit); versioned DOM-API allowlist, file-granular.
- [[Worthiness Audit]]: advisory two-axis (honesty + worthiness) review of emergent-surface tests; fresh-context reviewer proposes keep/fix/delete, deletes human-gated, audit ledger sibling to the RED ledger; judge-independent structural a11y floor for the non-triviality signal; two-tier end-of-task surfacing.
- [[Worthiness Presence Gate]]: merge-time `gh pr merge` hook requiring each changed emergent test to carry a worthiness-ledger line matching its current content; presence + signal match only (never the verdict), scoped to the PR's changed emergent tests, fail-open.
<!-- gaia:maintainer-only:start -->
- [[Bundle-time Scrub]]: marker-strip + leak-check + runtime-deps; closes the audit-round loop with build-time enforcement.
<!-- gaia:maintainer-only:end -->

## Concepts

- [[GAIA Philosophy]]
- [[Coding Guidelines]]
- [[Design System]]
- [[Component Testing]]
- [[API Service Pattern]]
- [[Accessibility]]
- [[ESLint Fixes]]
- [[Forensics]]: read-only bug-report bridge with redaction and classification
- [[Test Runner]]
- [[Pre-commit Hooks]]
- [[Git Workflow]]
- [[PR Merge Workflow]]
- [[Task Orchestration]]
- [[Code Review Audit Agent]]
- [[Code Review Audit CI]]: pre-merge GitHub Actions gate; `GAIA-Audit:` trailer skip logic; adopter-tunable knobs at `.gaia/audit-ci.yml`.
- [[Registering a Code Audit Team Member]]: how-to for adding a new roster member: agent def, roster + builtin fallback, machinery wiring, finding_class bucket, recurrence-tally integration, and the local-gate checklist.
- [[Audit Disposition and Debt Fix]]: forced disposition of out-of-scope audit findings as deduped tech-debt issues; security-class divert; the /gaia-debt fix loop (single issue or recommended related batch, isolated per the team's git isolation policy) and statusline nudge.
- [[GitHub Labels]]: the label registry at `.gaia/labels.json`, the palette rule, the generated page, and `gaia labels sync` / `docs` / `check`.
- [[Issue Claim]]: the `in-progress` label as a generic claim spanning every issue type, claim-before-isolation, and merge-triggered release.
- [[Policy-Memory Loop]]: prune-first self-improvement; recurring finding_class -> statusline nudge -> `/gaia-harden` -> path-scoped rule -> `/gaia-audit` prunes only on obsolescence/redundancy/supersession/duplication.
- [[Incremental CI Skipping]]: required checks skip when the delta since they last passed green has no relevant files; `resolve-check-base.sh` / `resolve-audit-base.sh`.
- [[Claude Hooks]]
- [[OS Sandbox]]: two-tier sandbox-enablement preference (owner recommends, each machine resolves) and the honest `.env` deny-merge boundary.
- [[Claude Integration Conventions]]: Conventions for Claude's config surface: extension points, monorepo retrofit, service swaps, domain isolation.
- [[Local Working State]]: layout and retention of the gitignored `.gaia/local/` working-state folder; the SessionStart janitor that GCs orphaned audit markers, merged plan dirs, and stray empty dirs.
- [[Worktrees]]: the worktree model a feature author needs: tree identity from the acting event's working directory, the single main-checkout resolver, the single `.gaia/local` symlink, and the state registry's four scopes.
- [[Claude Skills]]
- [[Update Workflow]]: `/update-gaia` three-way diff, manifest classes (`owned` / `shared` / `wiki-owned`), `.gaia-merge` sidecar patches.
- [[Generated Regions]]: marker-delimited spans inside shipped files a shipped command regenerates; the region-aware merge oracle, the regeneration runner, and the trust model they operate inside.
<!-- gaia:maintainer-only:start -->
- [[Release Workflow]]: Maintainer flow: `/gaia-release`, `release.yml`, tarball scrubbing, `create-gaia` bootstrapper.
- [[Release-Notes]]
<!-- gaia:maintainer-only:end -->
- [[GAIA Spec]]: `/gaia-spec`: Socratic discovery wrapper around spec-kit; produces an immutable SPEC artifact and stops, printing a `/gaia-plan` prompt for a fresh session (a guard enforces the stop).
- [[GAIA Plan]]: `/gaia-plan`: feature plan + orchestrator scaffolding, clipboard handoff to a fresh session.
- [[GAIA Handoff]]: `/gaia-handoff`: session handoff doc.
- [[GAIA Pickup]]: `/gaia-pickup`: resume from the latest handoff.
- [[GAIA Audit]]: `/gaia-audit`: two-stage knowledge-store hygiene sweep.
- [[Wiki Sync]]: `/gaia-wiki sync` + drift hooks: keep the wiki convergent with code without spawned sub-Claudes.
- [[Wiki Consolidate]]: `/gaia-wiki consolidate`: cross-SPEC redundancy and contradiction audit; surfaces supersession candidates, reversed decisions, near-collision slugs, and subject-orphans.
- [[GAIA Init Workflow]]: `/gaia init` subcommands: strip-branding, configure-i18n, rename, wire-statusline, configure-automation, finalize, resume.
- [[GAIA CLI]]: the `.gaia/cli/` workspace, the `.gaia/cli/gaia` bundled binary, and the adoption ping (`gaia ping`) sent on `/gaia-init`, `/setup-gaia`, and `/update-gaia` completion.
- [[Token Cost Readout]]: per-action token-to-dollar pricing off one shared pricing lib; the `by_model` field, the committed `token-rates.json` rate table, the roll-up's read-time dollar block, and the tally's own per-phase `dollars` snapshot in the `cost.json` sidecar record, each with its degrade markers.
- [[Cost Data Contract]]: the `cost.jsonl` record schema (every field + type), the execute aggregation rule, the schema_version evolution rule, the retention-at-merge rule, and `token-tally.sh` as the single source of truth for the emitted schema.
- [[Serena Integration]]: Serena handles live code; the wiki handles institutional memory.
- [[React Perf Diagnostic]]: `/gaia-react-perf`: measure-only runtime render-performance diagnostic built on bippy; capture -> reduce CLI -> ranked `memoDefeated` findings with a structural-fix cross-reference.
- [[Chromatic Opt-Out]]
