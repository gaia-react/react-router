# Decision: Co-located `tests/` Subfolder

Tests and Storybook stories live in a `tests/` folder **next to** the component, not in a global `__tests__` tree.

## Rationale

- Co-location makes ownership obvious and refactoring atomic
- Sibling test files clutter the component folder when you also have `types.ts`, `utils.ts`, `styles.module.css`, etc.
- The `tests/` subfolder restored visual tidiness without giving up co-location
- Same pattern extends to `assets/`, `hooks/`, `state/`

## Enforcement

ESLint enforces the folder structure via `eslint-plugin-check-file/filename-naming-convention`.
