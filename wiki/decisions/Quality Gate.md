# Decision: Mandatory Quality Gate

Every change must pass the Quality Gate. Pre-commit hooks enforce a subset; Claude runs the full pipeline below before any `git commit` that touches source; **unless the gate has nothing to check**.

## Steps

1. **Simplify**: run `simplify` skill; apply all endorsed changes.
2. **Localization check**: no hardcoded user-facing strings or unfilled keys.
3. `pnpm typecheck`: zero errors. This is the sole enforcer for type-only tests (`expectTypeOf`/`assertType`/`@ts-expect-error`), which [[TDD RED Verification]] exempts from its runtime-RED demand.
4. `pnpm lint`: zero errors, zero warnings. Runs `eslint --fix`, so it auto-fixes every fixable lint rule **and** Prettier formatting (Prettier is wired in as an `eslint` rule via `prettier/prettier`); only non-auto-fixable issues need manual attention. Hand-formatting while authoring is wasted effort; this step normalizes it. `pnpm lint` ignores `.gaia/**`; changes touching `.gaia/cli/**` also run `pnpm lint:cli` (`pnpm -C .gaia/cli lint`), the CLI's own ESLint config in its separate pnpm workspace.
5. `pnpm test --run`: all tests pass with **zero console warnings** (missing keys, HydrateFallback, etc. count as failures).
6. `pnpm pw`: all Playwright E2E tests pass.
7. **Dev smoke test**: start `pnpm dev`, curl a route, verify HTTP 200.
8. `pnpm build`: confirms production build.
9. **Fix all warnings before reporting**: never hand off with known warnings.
10. **Stop and report**: wait for user approval.

| Step          | Result |
| ------------- | ------ |
| Simplify      | ...    |
| Localization  | ...    |
| Type checking | ...    |
| Linting       | ...    |
| Unit tests    | ...    |
| E2E tests     | ...    |
| Dev server    | ...    |
| Build         | ...    |

## When to skip the gate

Skip the gate entirely if no staged file is something typecheck / lint / tests / build can inspect. The gate runs only when at least one staged file matches:

- **Source**: `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `*.js`, `*.jsx`, `*.mjs`, `*.cjs`, `*.css`
- **Gate-affecting config**: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `tsconfig*.json`, `vite.config.*`, `vitest.config.*`, `playwright.config.*`, `eslint.config.*`, `.gaia/cli/eslint.config.mjs`

Pure markdown, `.claude/**`, `wiki/**`, image, or other non-source-affecting commits skip straight to the commit step.

Quick check:

```bash
git diff --cached --name-only -z | tr '\0' '\n' | grep -E '\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx|mjs|cjs|css)$|^(package\.json|pnpm-lock\.yaml|tsconfig.*\.json|vite\.config\.|vitest\.config\.|playwright\.config\.|eslint\.config\.)'
```

`-z` and the `tr` back to newlines are both load-bearing. Under git's default `core.quotePath`, a path-listing command C-quotes any path carrying a non-ASCII byte, so a staged `app/components/café.test.ts` prints as `"app/components/caf\303\251.test.ts"`, whose last character is a double quote. The `$`-anchored extension alternation no longer meets a bare path, the grep returns empty, and the gate is skipped on a real source change. `-z` turns the quoting off; the `tr` is what gives the anchor a bare path to match again. <!-- gaia:hypothetical app/components/café.test.ts: a worked example of C-quoting an accented path, not a file this repo has -->

**Skip only on a positive answer.** If the grep returns nothing and the check itself ran, skip the gate. If the check cannot answer, the `git` call fails or nothing runs it, run the gate: an unanswered check is not an empty staged set.

## Behavior when the gate runs

- **Fix issues as you encounter them** rather than just reporting them.
- All warnings/issues (typecheck errors, lint errors/warnings, test console warnings like missing i18n keys or HydrateFallback, runtime errors) must be resolved before the commit; never commit with known warnings.
- After fixing, **STOP and report results to the user**; do not commit until the user reviews and approves.

Localization: all user-facing strings must be localized; no hardcoded strings in JSX, no keys without values.

## Source of truth

This page is the source of truth for quality gate steps. The always-loaded `.claude/rules/quality-gate.md` rule points commits at this page.

See [[Pre-commit Hooks]], [[PR Merge Workflow]], [[Task Orchestration]], [[Claude Hooks]] (the source-edit and Bash safeguards keep `.env`, lockfile, secrets, and destructive-git footguns out of the staged surface before the gate ever runs).

<!-- gaia:maintainer-only:start -->
The Forensics Triage Workflow runs its own CI gate (`.github/forensics/run-quality-gate.sh`: install → typecheck → lint → test → knip) on every auto-fix branch; gate failure abandons the branch and demotes the issue to `needs-human` instead of opening a partial PR. That gate is distinct from the developer Quality Gate above: it adds `pnpm knip` because it runs post-task against a complete tree, whereas the dev gate omits knip (see `.claude/rules/knip.md`).
