# Wiki Management

The wiki is critical infrastructure; it decays when drift between code and documentation grows unchecked. To keep it accurate and focused, the CLI provides a set of deterministic primitives for evaluating, logging, and auditing wiki state.

## Primitives

**`gaia wiki state`**: Outputs current sync state: `head_short` (short HEAD SHA), `state_sha`, `commits_ahead` (drift count), `reachable` (whether recorded SHA is in HEAD's history), and `suggested_base`. When `reachable` is false, `suggested_base` is the newest commit on HEAD's first-parent chain at or older than `last_evaluated_at`, a recovery baseline that lets a sync resume the un-evaluated window after a squash- or rebase-merge orphans the recorded SHA, instead of discarding it. It is empty when reachable or when no baseline resolves. Used by hooks and commands to detect when a sync is needed.

**`gaia wiki commit-classify`**: Evaluates commits since a baseline SHA. For each commit, outputs `suggestion` (`WORTHY` or `SKIP`) based on subject and file paths. WORTHY commits warrant deep-read and wiki update; SKIP commits can be logged without wiki edits. The classification is deterministic; same commit always produces the same suggestion. A git failure while reading the range propagates as a `git_failed` error rather than resolving to an empty commit list, so a transient failure is distinguishable from a genuinely empty `<since>..HEAD` range.

**`gaia wiki state-init <sha>`**: Creates `wiki/.state.json` seeded from `<sha>`; refuses if the file already exists. Bootstrap primitive used during repo onboarding before the first `/gaia-wiki sync`.

**`gaia wiki state-bump <field> <value>`**: Atomically updates `wiki/.state.json`, preserving sibling fields and key order. Used by `/gaia-wiki sync` to advance `last_evaluated_sha` and `last_evaluated_at`; used by `/gaia-wiki consolidate` to advance `last_consolidated_sha`.

**`gaia wiki log-prepend`**: Appends a single line to `wiki/log.md` in the format `- <YYYY-MM-DD> <sha> <decision> - <reason>`. Atomic insertion after frontmatter, newest entries on top. One call per commit.

**`gaia wiki page-index`**: Walks `wiki/` frontmatter and counts inbound/outbound wikilinks per page. Used by orphan and redundancy detection.

**`gaia wiki orphans`**: Lists pages with zero inbound links (newline-separated). Candidates for archival or cross-linking.

**`gaia wiki near-collisions`**: Groups pages per domain (decisions, concepts, modules, etc.) and finds near-duplicate titles using Levenshtein distance. Used by `/gaia-wiki consolidate` to surface redundancy.

**`gaia wiki dead-paths`**: Lists backticked repo paths in `wiki/` body prose that don't exist on disk. Used by `/gaia-wiki lint` to catch zombie filename references after merges and renames. A path that is absent by design rather than rotted is exempt, so the count this check exists to move carries no permanent floor. The scanner owns the exemptions that state a fact about the repository's layout; a path that is an illustration is exempted on its own wiki line instead, by a marker the scan also reports once it stops exempting anything. `.claude/skills/gaia/references/wiki/lint.md` owns how that marker is written and what each report means.

**`gaia wiki sync land`**: Branch-aware landing of staged wiki changes: commits in place on a feature branch; on `main`, stages a branch, opens a PR, queues auto-merge, and takes one bounded wait on it. When the merge lands inside that wait the command cleans up locally (returns to base, pulls, deletes the branch, prunes); on the common path the merge gate outlasts any wait that fits in a single invocation, so it returns with the local cleanup outstanding and `sync await` or the session-start janitor completes it. Used by `/gaia-wiki sync` as the deterministic write step.

**`gaia wiki sync await`**: Takes another bounded wait on an outstanding landing, in the same session, and completes the local catch-up when the merge lands: deletes the `wiki-sync/*` branch and leaves the base branch at `origin/<base>`. It takes no branch argument and discovers the pending branch itself rather than trusting a name parsed out of prose, so a call is correct whether or not a landing is outstanding; nothing pending is a silent no-op. The `/gaia-wiki` router therefore calls it unconditionally after the landing stage. How many times the router may re-run it on a still-pending merge is the router's own bound, stated where the router is: `.claude/skills/gaia/references/wiki.md`. `GAIA_WIKI_AWAIT_CEILING_SECONDS` bounds the verb's own cumulative wait across calls, measured from the first one and floor-clamped, and `0` disables the await outright and leaves the catch-up to the janitor. Never fails: every situation it can observe exits 0, because the landing itself already succeeded and only the local catch-up is at stake.

**`gaia wiki chain <begin|commit|finish>`**: Manages the branch lifecycle for the `/gaia-wiki` full chain so all stages (sync, consolidate, lint) land in one PR rather than opening separate PRs.

- `begin` (before sync): cuts a `wiki-sync/<date>-<sha>` branch from `main`; no-op on a feature branch, where stages commit in place.
- `commit` (after each stage): commits that stage's `wiki/` changes in place; gracefully no-ops when nothing changed; refuses non-wiki changes.
- `finish` (after lint): pushes the branch, opens one PR for all stage commits, enables auto-merge, and takes one bounded wait on the merge. When it lands inside that wait, `finish` cleans up locally; on the common path the merge gate outlasts the wait, so it returns to base with the local cleanup outstanding for `sync await` or the session-start janitor. Drops the branch if it is empty. Leaves an aborted dirty tree in place for review. No-op for in-place runs on a feature branch.

Standalone `/gaia-wiki sync`, `/gaia-wiki consolidate`, and `/gaia-wiki lint` are unaffected; the chain commands are invoked only by the no-arg `/gaia-wiki` full-chain wrapper.

## Shipped-surface boundary check

`wiki/` ships, so a page `/gaia-wiki sync` authors is a newly-shipping file the moment it's created. Before landing, sync stages its own authored pages and runs the release-staging build against them, the same check CI's advisory shipped-surface leak check runs, moved ahead of the pull request rather than discovered after it's open. It repairs what a page's own prose caused (a pointer at a release-excluded path, a wikilink to a release-excluded page), bounded at three attempts, and records what it can't repair or what a newly-created page still owes the distribution manifest in the sync summary instead of staying silent about it.

## State file

`wiki/.state.json` is the single source of truth for sync state:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "last_evaluated_sha": "...",
  "last_evaluated_at": "2026-05-07T...",
  "last_consolidated_sha": "...",
  "last_consolidated_at": "2026-05-07T..."
}
```

Two commands own disjoint subsets:

- `/gaia-wiki sync` owns `last_evaluated_sha` and `last_evaluated_at`
- `/gaia-wiki consolidate` owns `last_consolidated_sha` and `last_consolidated_at`

Each writer uses `state-bump` to preserve the other's fields. Hooks and other commands are read-only consumers.
