# Decision: TypeScript 7 Readiness

`tsconfig.json` tracks the TypeScript 7 strict baseline ahead of the upgrade, so adopting the native compiler (`tsgo`) is a dependency swap rather than a config migration.

## Current posture

- `stableTypeOrdering: true` and `noUncheckedSideEffectImports: true` are enabled under TypeScript 6, matching TS7 defaults.
- No TS7-removed options are present: no `baseUrl`, no `downlevelIteration`, no `target: es5`, no `moduleResolution: node/classic`, and `esModuleInterop` stays `true`.
- Baseline is already TS7-shaped: `module: ESNext`, `moduleResolution: Bundler`, `target: ES2022`, `strict: true`, explicit `types`.
- `tsc` runs typecheck-only (`noEmit`); the bundler emits. TS7's not-yet-shipped emit, watch, and declaration features do not apply.

## What gates the upgrade

The lint stack is the consumer of TypeScript's programmatic API that gates the upgrade, because its type-aware rules depend on the type checker. `typescript-eslint` is not a direct dependency in `package.json`; the type-aware rules reach the project transitively through [[gaia-lint]] (the sole import in `eslint.config.mjs`), which pulls the typescript-eslint toolchain in via its bundled plugin set. The gate therefore lives in that package's dependency graph rather than the consumer's `package.json`. TS7 stabilizes that API at 7.1, not 7.0. Until 7.1, the native compiler can only run alongside TypeScript 6 as a second toolchain, so the clean single-toolchain swap waits for 7.1.

The lint stack is not the only consumer. GAIA tooling that reads source through the parser imports `typescript` directly, and those readers depend on the same programmatic API, so the 7.1 gate covers them too. `git grep -lE "require\('typescript'\)|from 'typescript'" -- '*.ts' '*.mjs'` lists them.

## Enforcement

`gaia.updateDepsHold` in `package.json` carries `{"typescript": "6.0"}`, so the `/update-deps` skill caps discovery at the 6.0 line: patches on that line still land, and 6.1, 7.0, and anything higher are never offered. The hold is committed rather than a local snooze, so it applies in CI runs too and holds until the maintainer lifts it.

The ceiling pins two segments rather than one because 6.1 is already out of range independent of the 7.1 API question: typescript-eslint declares `typescript: ">=4.8.4 <6.1.0"`, so a `"6"` ceiling would offer a TypeScript minor the lint stack does not support. That gives the hold two independent lift triggers, whichever comes first: the typescript-eslint peer range widening past 6.1, or TypeScript 7.1 shipping with the stabilized programmatic API the type-aware rules in [[gaia-lint]] depend on.

`typescript` resolves to its own singleton update group, not a companion group with `@types/node`. A compiler bump and an ambient Node type-definition bump have independent migration guides and independent blast radius, so a hold on one must not stall the other.

## resolveJsonModule

Retained even though GAIA imports no JSON. GAIA is a foundation for [[React Router]] projects, JSON imports are a first-class Vite pattern, and the option is inert until an import exists. See [[TypeScript Language Files]].

## allowJs

Off. GAIA is strict-TS-first; type-checking JavaScript is an explicit adopter opt-in, not a clone default.
