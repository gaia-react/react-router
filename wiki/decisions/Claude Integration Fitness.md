# Claude Integration Fitness

`/gaia-fitness` is a health check + auto-heal that answers one question, "how well-configured and coherent is this project's Claude integration?", and fixes what it can. A single invocation runs three phases: triage (walk the eight graded categories below), heal (lane-aware Fixer subagents auto-apply confident fixes inside a bounded loop with oscillation detection), and verify (re-run the affected checks).

The protocol is harness-agnostic: `/gaia-fitness` runs it standalone, and it is written so a larger audit harness can run the same protocol over the same eight categories as one bucket of a deeper loop.

The `/gaia-fitness` skill's harness layer handles branch / repo-state and publishing: creating a `chore/gaia-fitness-<timestamp>` branch when HEAD is on the default branch and fixes are available, running triage-only when HEAD is detached or a rebase / merge / cherry-pick / bisect is in progress, and, after the report, gating on a single publish confirmation that commits the healed changes and drives the PR to merge (commit and push only on a non-default branch). See the `/gaia-fitness` skill reference for the full branching and publish algorithm. That harness layer is not part of the triage/heal protocol described here.

`/update-gaia` three-way-merges this page, so project-specific check classes you add here survive GAIA upgrades, and `/gaia-wiki` lints it. `/gaia-fitness` runs whatever classes the page defines alongside the shipped ones.

## Check Taxonomy

Eight graded categories. Each category produces findings at `error`, `warning`, or `info` severity; the category grade derives from the worst severity found (see Grading Rubric).

### 1. Hook integrity

Checks `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json` hook entries:

- Every hook command path exists on disk and is executable.
- Hook command paths are rooted so they resolve independently of the shell's working directory. A bare repo-relative path (e.g. `.claude/hooks/wiki-session-start.sh`) is the shape to flag: it resolves against whatever directory the shell is in, and a script that is not found exits 127, which is not a blocking status, so the guard layer fails open with nothing reported. `.gaia/scripts/check-hook-command-rooting.sh` is the authority on what counts as rooted and states the property rather than a literal spelling, so read it rather than matching a remembered prefix.
- Every hook event name is a valid Claude Code hook event.

The valid Claude Code hook events (the canonical list the auditor checks against, so it does not re-derive an incomplete set from memory) are: `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `UserPromptExpansion`, `Notification`, `Stop`, `SubagentStop`, `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `WorktreeCreate`, `WorktreeRemove`, plus any project-specific events the repo registers (a project that wires its own event names extends this list; an unfamiliar name is a finding only when it is neither in the list above nor registered by the project's own tooling).

Findings here are typically `error` severity.

### 2. Skill / command / agent frontmatter

Checks `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `.claude/commands/*.md`, and `.claude/agents/*.md`:

- `name` and `description` frontmatter fields present, non-empty, and not placeholder text.
- No `name` collision across the three surfaces.

One finding per defect, naming the file path and the remediation.

### 3. Rule hygiene

Checks `.claude/rules/*.md` and cross-references from `CLAUDE.md`:

- No `@`-import of skill files inside a rule; always-loaded rules that transitively preload skills bloat every session.
- Path-scoping glob syntax in rule frontmatter is valid.
- Content-vs-glob coherence: a rule path-scoped to a narrow glob must contain advice relevant when those paths are edited. The glob is an activation trigger (it controls when the rule surfaces), not a claim that the advice is logically confined to those paths, so universal advice deliberately narrowed to an activation context is correct (e.g. portability advice scoped to `.claude/**`). Flag only the inverse defect: a narrow glob whose body is irrelevant to the globbed paths.
- Rules referenced by `CLAUDE.md` exist at the cited path.

Findings here are typically `warning` severity.

### 4. `CLAUDE.md` hygiene

Checks `CLAUDE.md` (root and any subfolder `CLAUDE.md`s the root names in its folder map):

- Size vs. the project's stated size guidance.
- Every `@`-import resolves to an existing file.
- Every subfolder `CLAUDE.md` named in a folder map exists.
- No absolute machine-local path used as an operative reference (an `@`-import target, a cited config or source path, or a path an instruction tells the agent to read or write). A home-directory path quoted as a counter-example or naming a location the prose forbids (e.g. the machine-local memory directory) is descriptive prose, not a finding, mirroring the prose carve-out in `.claude/rules/instruction-files.md`.
- No dead backticked path references (paths cited in backticks that do not exist on disk).

One finding per defect, naming the location and the remediation.

### 5. Settings hygiene

Checks `.claude/settings.json`:

- File is valid JSON; unparseable settings is an immediate category `F`.
- Permission entries whose pattern is a strict subset of another entry's glob are redundant (`info` or `warning`).
- Any secret-shaped value in the `env` block (`error`).
- `.claude/settings.local.json` not listed in `.gitignore` (`warning`).

Permission-glob semantics: the rule the auditor applies for the strict-subset check, so it does not over-flag distinct entries: `Bash(cmd)` matches the exact command with no arguments; `Bash(cmd:*)` matches `cmd` invoked _with_ arguments. The two are distinct entries, not a redundant pair; a project that runs a command both ways keeps both deliberately. Flag a redundancy only on a genuine strict-subset shadow, e.g. `Bash(git status)` is fully covered by `Bash(git:*)` and is the redundant one.

### 6. GAIA-install fitness

Checks the GAIA installation:

- Per-file drift between the current contents of files tracked by `.gaia/manifest.json` and the contents the installed GAIA version shipped. When a reference snapshot of the installed version's shipped contents is present, each drifted file is one `warning` finding. This check needs that snapshot; when none is present (a fresh clone or after a cache clear), the per-file diff is skipped rather than treated as drift, and version-currency plus `gaia-maintainer release manifest --check` carry installation freshness instead. Provided both of those pass, the no-snapshot case records no finding at all for this bullet, not even `info`; it is a pass, not an unresolved question.
- Installed GAIA version vs. latest release: if behind, one `info` finding recommending `/update-gaia`. This is the only `info` this category emits; a version-current install with no snapshot present still records no finding.

### 7. Wiki fitness

Checks wiki health by invoking the existing `gaia wiki` primitives; this category does not reimplement them:

- `wiki/.state.json` staleness vs. `app/**` HEAD: if `commits_ahead` is non-zero, or `reachable` is false (the recorded `last_evaluated_sha` is unreachable from HEAD, e.g. after a rebase, which pins `commits_ahead` to zero), one `info` finding recommending `/gaia-wiki sync`.
- `gaia wiki dead-paths`: any dead backticked path reference in wiki body prose is one `warning` finding per occurrence.
- `gaia wiki orphans`: any orphan page (zero inbound links) is one `info` finding per page, recommending `/gaia-wiki sync` to cross-link or archive.

### 8. Cost-rate fitness

Checks that the cost ledger can actually be priced. Haiku: the detection is a script run, not a judgment.

- `.gaia/scripts/cost-unpriced-scan.sh` names every model the ledger carries that the rate card in force has no window for, and counts the rows whose dollar figure is therefore a lower bound. Any unpriced model is one `warning` finding per model, carrying the row count. A newly released model has no rate in the shipped `.gaia/scripts/token-rates.json` until a GAIA release ships one, so this condition recurs on every model launch rather than being a one-off.
- A model the machine-local overlay is already pricing is **not** a finding. The scan recomputes each row against the card in force, overlay included, so a model the operator has already remedied stops being reported.

The severity is `warning` rather than `info` because the figure is wrong rather than merely absent, and wrong in the direction that hides: of the affected records in the condition's first observed instance, only a third totalled zero, while the rest reported a plausible non-zero figure because their other models priced correctly and only the unpriced model's share was dropped. A `$0.00` total is noticeable; a 30%-light total is not.

This category never proposes a number. See [Rate remedies are human-gated](#rate-remedies-are-human-gated).

### Decided / not findings

Things audits keep re-discovering that are not findings:

**Slash commands appear under "skills" in Claude Code's surface listing.** `.claude/commands/` files register through Claude Code's plugin/skill discovery and appear in the same listing as actual skills. This is a Claude Code surface artifact. Skip the round-trip.

**`wiki/.state.json` lagging HEAD.** Normal pre-release state. The session-start hook reports drift informationally; the wiki-fitness category surfaces it as `info` (not `error` or `warning`) and recommends `/gaia-wiki sync`. Do not escalate to a blocking finding.

**Release-excluded wiki pages flagged as orphans by `gaia wiki orphans`.** Expected state, not a defect. Shipped pages must not `[[wikilink]]` release-excluded pages (enforced by `wikilink-to-excluded`); plain-text references to them are correct. `gaia wiki orphans` cannot see release-exclusion, so it will always flag such a page. Surface as `info`; do not escalate to a blocking finding.

**`@`-imports that use valid repo-relative paths.** An `@`-import is a finding only when it imports a skill file from inside a rule. Imports of always-loaded rule files from `CLAUDE.md` are the correct pattern; do not flag them.

**Dead backticked path in `wiki/log.md` or `wiki/hot.md`.** These files are exempt from `gaia wiki dead-paths` by design; `wiki/log.md` is the append-only historical record; `wiki/hot.md` is the auto-overwritten session cache. Do not raise dead-path findings against either.

**A bare `Bash(cmd)` permission entry alongside `Bash(cmd:*)`.** Not a shadowed-permission finding; they match different invocations (no-args vs. with-args). See the permission-glob semantics note under [Settings hygiene](#5-settings-hygiene) for the strict-subset rule that governs this check.

**A `WorktreeCreate` or `WorktreeRemove` hook entry.** Not an unknown-event finding; both are in the canonical event list under [Hook integrity](#1-hook-integrity), so a project that registers either is wiring a real event and the auditor says nothing about it. GAIA registers neither: the harness creates and removes worktrees natively, and GAIA's own worktree work is provisioning, which rides `SessionStart` and `PostToolUse` on the `EnterWorktree` matcher instead. Their *absence* is therefore also not a finding. (If worktree symlink-handoff is demonstrably broken, that is a separate concern, not a fitness finding.)

**A skill directory with no `SKILL.md` that is a shared-reference bucket.** Not a frontmatter finding. The frontmatter category checks `*/SKILL.md` under `.claude/skills/`, but a directory whose files are individually tracked in `.gaia/manifest.json` and Read by path from command surfaces (rather than invoked by name) is a deliberate reference bucket, not a discoverable skill; a `SKILL.md` would be redundant. Surface a missing one as, at most, `info`, and do not escalate to a blocking finding. (`.claude/skills/gaia/` is the canonical case: its `references/` files are dispatched directly by the gaia-* commands.)

---

## Grading Rubric

Per-category grade is deterministic given the finding set for that category. The overall grade is the floor of the eight category grades (one `D` drags the headline to `D`).

### Per-category bands

| Grade  | Condition                                                                                                                        |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A+** | Zero findings in the category                                                                                                    |
| **A**  | One or two `info` findings, no `warning` or `error`                                                                              |
| **A−** | Three or more `info` findings, no `warning` or `error`                                                                           |
| **B+** | One `warning`, no `error`                                                                                                        |
| **B**  | Two `warning`s, no `error`                                                                                                       |
| **B−** | Three or more `warning`s, no `error`                                                                                             |
| **C+** | One `error`                                                                                                                      |
| **C**  | Two `error`s                                                                                                                     |
| **C−** | Three `error`s                                                                                                                   |
| **D+** | Four `error`s                                                                                                                    |
| **D**  | Five `error`s                                                                                                                    |
| **D−** | Six or more `error`s                                                                                                             |
| **F**  | Category is structurally broken, e.g. `.claude/settings.json` is unparseable (settings F); no `CLAUDE.md` exists (`CLAUDE.md` F) |

The grade keys off the worst severity present, then the count at that severity: any `error` → the C/D band for the error count; else any `warning` → the B band for the warning count; else any `info` → the A band for the info count; else `A+`. Every band in the table, including `A−` and `C−`, is reachable for a single category, and the overall (floor) grade can therefore land on any of them. The exact +/− band thresholds are tunable; adjust the counts above for your project's tolerance.

### Overall grade

The overall grade equals the floor of the eight category grades. One `D` in any category drags the overall grade to `D`.

### Ordinal encoding

Grades ordinal-encode A+=12, A=11, A−=10, B+=9, B=8, B−=7, C+=6, C=5, C−=4, D+=3, D=2, D−=1, F=0. This encoding supports per-category trending if a project wants it. No 0–100 score is exposed; a percentage would be 100 minus arbitrary per-finding weights, which is false precision the letter-grade scale avoids.

---

## Severity Vocabulary

Every finding carries exactly three fields:

- **`severity`**: one of `error`, `warning`, `info` (lowercase, exactly these three).
- **`file`**: repo-relative path, with `:line` appended where the finding is attributable to a specific line.
- **`remediation`**: one-line description of what to do.

The chat report groups findings by the eight category names above.

---

## Triage → Heal → Verify Protocol

When `/gaia-fitness` runs this protocol, the harness is minimal: no Orchestrator-above-Triager layer, no preserved per-cycle artifact directories, no escalation handoff. On loop exhaustion it simply reports the unresolved findings with the grade. (A larger harness composing this protocol can wrap it in its own deeper loop; the protocol below does not assume one.)

### Roles

- **Orchestrator**: owns the cycle loop and the final report. When `/gaia-fitness` runs, this is the `/gaia-fitness` skill reference.
- **Auditors**: per-category check executors dispatched during the triage phase.
- **Fixers**: edit agents dispatched during the heal phase, lane-aware so multiple run in parallel without merge conflicts.

### Triage phase

The Orchestrator dispatches the eight category checks as **parallel subagents** (or parallel tool calls; the verifiable property is the structured findings artifact, not the dispatch mechanism):

| Category                            | Model      | What it does                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hook integrity                      | **Haiku**  | File-exists + executable checks on hook command paths; event-name validation against a known-valid list                                             |
| Settings hygiene                    | **Haiku**  | `jq` parse of `settings.json`; glob-subset detection; secret-pattern grep on `env` values; `.gitignore` check for `settings.local.json`             |
| GAIA-install fitness                | **Haiku**  | Hash-diff of manifest-tracked files against installed-version checksums; version string comparison                                                  |
| Wiki fitness                        | **Haiku**  | `gaia wiki state` for staleness; `gaia wiki dead-paths`; `gaia wiki orphans`                                                                        |
| Skill / command / agent frontmatter | **Sonnet** | Frontmatter completeness + placeholder detection (requires judgment); name-collision check                                                          |
| Rule hygiene                        | **Sonnet** | Content-vs-glob coherence (requires judgment about whether advice is universal or path-specific); `@`-import detection; `CLAUDE.md` cross-reference |
| `CLAUDE.md` hygiene                 | **Sonnet** | Size evaluation vs. project guidance (requires judgment); dead-path + absolute-path grep; `@`-import resolution; folder-map cross-reference         |

**Structured findings only flow back to the Orchestrator.** Raw command output stays in subagent context to avoid return-budget truncation. Each auditor returns an array of `{severity, file, remediation, fingerprint}` objects.

The auditors are recall-oriented; they surface anything suspicious from a fixed knowledge cutoff, so they over-flag (an unfamiliar-but-valid hook event, a permission pair that only looks redundant, a schema example mistaken for an unfilled placeholder). **The Orchestrator dispatches each auditor with an explicit coverage directive** in its prompt, so recall does not ride on the auditor's own bar: `Surface every candidate, including ones you are uncertain about or judge low-severity. Do not filter for importance or confidence: adjudication is a separate stage. Assign each finding a severity so the Orchestrator can rank and drop.` A literal-minded auditor left to self-filter under-reports exactly the borderline judgment calls (frontmatter substantiveness, content-vs-glob coherence, size-vs-guidance) this triage exists to catch, which starves the adjudication stage of the candidates it is built to sift. The Orchestrator adjudicates every finding against the repo before grading: drop the false positives (consult [Decided / not findings](#decided--not-findings)), keep the real ones. The grades and the heal phase operate on the adjudicated set, not the raw auditor output.

### Heal phase

The Orchestrator dispatches **lane-aware Fixer subagents (Sonnet)** in parallel. Fixer lanes:

| Lane                 | Owns                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`claude-surface`** | `.claude/skills/**`, `.claude/commands/**`, `.claude/agents/**`, `.claude/hooks/**`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/**` |
| **`settings`**       | `.claude/settings.json`                                                                                              |
| **`gitignore`**      | `.gitignore`                                                                                                         |
| **`manifest`**       | `.gaia/manifest.json`                                                                                                |
| **`rate-overlay`**   | `.gaia/local/token-rates.local.json` (human-gated, never a subagent; see below)                                      |

Manifest edits must serialize; dispatch only a single Fixer at a time when `.gaia/manifest.json` is touched.

#### Rate remedies are human-gated

The `rate-overlay` lane is the one lane the Orchestrator runs **itself**, in the main thread, and the one lane that asks before it writes. Two independent reasons, and both have to hold or the lane would be ordinary:

**A deterministic process must never invent a rate.** Pricing is not available from the Models API, which returns an id, a display name, capabilities, and token limits, with no pricing field, so a rate is only obtainable from a docs page. A name or tier heuristic is not a substitute and would be actively wrong: it would price a `fable`-tier model at `opus` rates, and it could never produce a time-windowed introductory rate. A confidently wrong rate is worse than a zero, because a zero is noticeable and a plausible wrong number is not, which is the whole reason this category exists. So the Orchestrator resolves each rate through the `claude-api` skill, whose own trigger forbids answering pricing from memory, and proposes the entry rather than writing it.

**The publish gate does not cover this lane.** Every other lane writes a tracked file, so its edit reaches the operator through the Step 7 commit/PR gate, and a Fixer can safely write without asking. `.gaia/local/` is gitignored: an overlay entry never appears in a diff, never reaches a PR, and never gets reviewed. Inheriting the other lanes' "write now, gate at publish" posture would therefore write an unreviewed rate into the operator's pricing with no gate anywhere. The consent has to be at the write.

The lane's outcome is one of three, and the third is not a failure:

| Outcome | When |
| --- | --- |
| Entry written | The rate resolved and the operator consented. |
| Proposed, not written | The rate resolved and the operator declined, or did not answer. The finding is reported unresolved with the proposed entry so it can be pasted by hand. |
| Not proposed | The rate could not be resolved from a real source. The finding is reported unresolved. **Never fill the gap with a guess**, which is the whole rule. |

A written entry keeps the finding open in spirit: the shipped table is still behind, and the entry is meant to be folded upstream into `token-rates.json` at the next release rather than to live in the overlay forever.

If a single finding's fix straddles multiple lanes, dispatch one Fixer with multi-lane scope (sequential edits inside that Fixer) rather than splitting across Fixers.

**Too-invasive fixes:** a fix a Fixer judges too invasive to apply without product context, e.g. restructuring a `.claude/rules/` file, splitting an oversized `CLAUDE.md`, changing the structure of hook logic, is **left unapplied**. The Fixer surfaces it in the report with a **recommended approach** (a description of what to do and why) so the operator can apply it manually.

### Oscillation detection

Finding fingerprint format:

```
{check-id}:{file}:{line}:{first-40-chars-of-match-text}
```

A finding whose fingerprint appears in both the current cycle's findings and the prior cycle's findings has survived a Fixer dispatch unchanged; the loop stops for that finding and it is reported as unresolved.

Detection is mechanical: compare fingerprint sets across consecutive cycles. Any fingerprint in both sets triggers loop termination for that finding.

### Bounded loop

Default: **3 cycles** (tunable; adjust the cycle count in this page for your project's tolerance). Each cycle runs triage → heal → verify. The loop exits early when all findings resolve. On loop exhaustion, `/gaia-fitness` reports the remaining unresolved findings with the affected category grades and the overall grade. No escalation handoff; it reports and stops.

**Composed inside a deeper loop.** When a larger audit harness runs this protocol as one bucket of its own cycle loop, that outer loop subsumes this bounded loop: the harness runs the **triage phase** once per outer cycle, folds the fitness findings into its own findings set and oscillation guard, and dispatches fixes through the [heal-phase](#heal-phase) Fixer lanes above. It does not nest a second 3-cycle loop or a second oscillation guard inside each outer cycle. The bounded loop and the oscillation detection described here govern only the standalone `/gaia-fitness` invocation; the per-category grading rubric and Fixer lanes apply unchanged in both modes.

### Verify phase

After each heal cycle, re-run the affected category checks. Recompute the affected category grades and the overall grade. If the overall grade reaches A+, the loop exits clean. The final verify cycle, the one whose recomputed grade is reported (on a clean A+ exit or at loop exhaustion), re-runs all eight categories rather than only the affected ones, so a fix in one lane that regresses a check in a zero-finding category is caught before the loop reports.

## Findings Schema

```json
{
  "category": "hook-integrity",
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "error",
      "file": ".claude/settings.json:14",
      "remediation": "Hook command path '.claude/hooks/missing.sh' does not exist; create the file or remove the hook entry.",
      "fingerprint": "hook-integrity:.claude/settings.json:14:.claude/hooks/missing.sh"
    }
  ]
}
```

`findings` is the only content that flows back from auditors to the Orchestrator. The Orchestrator assembles the per-category arrays into the chat report.

## Chat Report Format

The report is a single self-sizing ASCII card, emitted as a fenced code block in the chat reply. It has three regions:

- **Header**: the command and the **overall grade** (floor of the eight category grades), right-aligned.
- **Grades block**: the eight categories sorted alphabetically by name; each row carries a right-aligned severity-count note (`1 warning`, `2 errors, 1 info`) and the category grade.
- **Findings block**: findings grouped by category, each as `[severity] file` with the `remediation` wrapped beneath. Omitted entirely on a clean run.

The card carries no footer; the `/gaia-fitness` skill prints post-heal instructions as prose below it.

The card width self-sizes: `clamp(longest content line, floor, min(terminal width, 120))`, where `floor` keeps the grades block from colliding. Remediation text wraps to the chosen width, so the card grows to one line per finding on a wide terminal and wraps on a narrow one. `/gaia-fitness` renders it with `gaia fitness render-card`, which takes the findings JSON on stdin and a `--cols` width; the skill's report step builds that JSON from the adjudicated findings and pastes the rendered card into the reply.

Example (overall **B+**, the floor of one `B+` category over seven `A`/`A+` categories):

The overall grade is the floor of the eight category grades: the single `B+` category sets the headline; the seven `A`/`A+` categories do not lift it.

## Extensibility

Add a project-specific check class by appending a new numbered section under [Check Taxonomy](#check-taxonomy) above. Format:

```markdown
### 9. <Category name>

<What it checks and how. Describe the model (Haiku or Sonnet) and what the auditor does.>
```

`/gaia-fitness` runs whatever classes this page defines. `/update-gaia` three-way-merges the page so your additions survive GAIA upgrades. `/gaia-wiki` lints the page. The extension point is this page itself; edit it directly, the way the `code-audit-frontend` agent picks up extension files from `.claude/agents/code-audit-frontend/`.
