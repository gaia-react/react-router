# Form Submit Flow

The end-to-end path of a form submission in GAIA.

1. User fills out a form built from [[Form Components]].
2. Conform's `useForm({ onValidate })` runs `parseWithZod(formData, {schema})` client-side for instant feedback.
3. On submit, the form `POST`s to the route's `action`.
4. The route action runs the **same** `parseWithZod` server-side (source of truth):
   ```ts
   const submission = parseWithZod(formData, {schema});
   if (submission.status !== 'success') return submission.reply();
   ```
5. On success, action does the work (call API via `app/services/`), then either:
   - Returns `redirect(...)` for a navigation
   - Returns `dataWithToast(...)` from `remix-toast` for an inline toast
6. Conform binds errors back to fields automatically.

## Stateful custom inputs

If the form contains a stateful custom input (e.g. `YearMonthDay`), wire it via `useInputControl` so it stays in sync with Conform's validation state. See [[Form Components]].

## Toasts

`remix-toast` cookie + `Sonner` UI render success/error toasts on redirect. The root loader reads the toast via `getToast(request)` and passes it to `<Toast />` which calls `notify[toast.type](toast)`.

See [[Routing]], [[Form Components]], [[i18n]].
