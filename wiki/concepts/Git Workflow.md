# Git Workflow

Two invariants, machine-enforced by `.claude/hooks/block-main-destructive-git.sh` (PreToolUse `Bash` hook with `if: Bash(git *)`). The hook emits `permissionDecision: "deny"` with a reason string, so Claude cannot bypass it without explicit user override.

## 1. Never commit directly to `main` or `master`

Always work on a feature branch. If HEAD is on `main`/`master`, create one first:

```bash
git switch -c <type>/<short-description>
```

Conventional prefixes in this repo: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `refactor/`, `test/`, `wiki/`

## 2. Never force-push to `main` or `master`

No `--force`, `--force-with-lease`, or `-f` to `main`/`master` — upstream history is shared. Fix conflicts with a merge or rebase on the feature branch, then open a PR.

See [[PR Merge Workflow]], [[Claude Hooks]].
