# Registering a Code Audit Team Member

The [[Code Audit Team]] gate dispatches specialized auditor members by file glob rather than running one generic reviewer over every diff. Adding a member is config plus an agent file: the dispatch resolver is generic over the roster, so registering a member never touches `.gaia/scripts/resolve-audit-members.sh` itself.

## Registration steps

### 1. Author the agent definition

Write `.claude/agents/<name>.md` following the shape of the existing members: `name` / `description` / `model` / `color` frontmatter, a **Remit and self-skip** section with the heading and the diff-base resolution and the mechanical self-skip detail (self-skipping cleanly, writing no marker, when nothing matches), **Review dimensions**, a **Finding Proof Gate**, **Findings grading** (which severities the member may use), an advisory-only or self-heal stance, **Cross-remit findings** handling, an **Output Format** section, the **Gate handshake** (mark / stamp / push / status), a **Findings sidecar** for the recurrence tally, and a **Methodology** summary. Leave the glob list and the filter instruction to the generated remit region, which the next step produces. The `description` still states the member's subject matter and self-heal stance in one line, since that's what a dispatching agent reads first, but no longer restates a glob.

The **Remit and self-skip** section also carries the scope-resolution obligation, byte-identical across every member definition: Capture your own content digest at scope resolution with `.gaia/scripts/audit-scope-digest.sh --capture`, and at marker-write time read that captured value back with `--read` and pass it as `--scope-digest`; never re-derive it in the writing call, and a rotation between the two means the review was superseded and you must be re-dispatched on the new HEAD.

### 2. Register in the roster

Add an entry to the `auditors:` list in `.gaia/audit-ci.yml`: `name`, `globs`, `scope` (`adopter` or `maintainer-only`), and `push_fixes`. Mirror the same entry, verbatim, into `_audit_scope_builtin_roster()` inside `.claude/hooks/lib/audit-scope.sh`, the built-in fallback roster the ownership classifier parses when `.gaia/audit-ci.yml` carries no `auditors:` block. The two stay in lockstep: a glob present in the config but missing from the fallback leaves that path ownerless whenever the fallback is the one in effect.

### 3. Generate the remit region

Run `bash .gaia/scripts/write-audit-remits.sh`. It reads `.gaia/audit-ci.yml` and writes each member's marker-delimited remit region into its agent definition, inserting the markers on a definition that has none. Everything outside the markers is left alone. Re-run it after any roster change: the roster check fails whenever a region disagrees with the roster entry that dispatches that member, and every one of its findings prints this command.

### 4. Wire into the machinery set

Add the new agent file's path to `AUDIT_MACHINERY_PATHS` in `.claude/hooks/lib/audit-machinery.sh`, and to the mirrored `GATE_MACHINERY_FILES` list in `.gaia/scripts/audit-machinery-complete.sh`. Every member's clearance marker keys to a content digest computed over the files it owns plus this machinery set; an agent file missing from either list rotates no digest when it changes, so a rewrite of the member's own instructions would merge unaudited by that member. `.gaia/scripts/audit-machinery-complete.sh` asserts the two lists agree.

### 5. Declare a scope-resolution anchor, only if the fence is not where the checker looks

`.gaia/scripts/check-scope-digest-adoption.sh` discovers members rather than carrying a list of them, so a new definition joins its scanned set with nothing to register. Its own header owns the list of what it verifies; exactly one of those assertions depends on a member telling it anything, the one placing the capture inside the member's own scope-resolution region. The checker assumes that region starts at `## Remit and self-skip`, which is where nearly every member resolves `KEY_BASE`/`BASE_SHA` and captures.

A member whose fence lives elsewhere needs one line: add `member|^<its heading regex>` to `GAIA_SDA_ANCHOR_OVERRIDES` in that script. `code-audit-frontend` is the standing example, whose fence sits under `### How to run`. Skipping this on a member that needs it does not fail open, the region extraction finds nothing and the check exits non-zero naming the member and the anchor that matched nothing.

### 6. Add a finding_class bucket, if the member needs new classes

A member reporting an **oracle** finding, backed by a deterministic tool (`react-doctor/`, `axe/`, `knip/`, `cve/`), needs no schema change: the tool owns the id space after its prefix, and any well-formed slug is valid. A member reporting findings in a genuinely new category needs a new closed-vocabulary bucket in the `finding_class` schema: a new prefix, a seeded `as const` union of specific classes, and that union folded into the closed-vocabulary set the validator checks against. Keep new classes genuine root-cause categories the member can assign reliably and repeatably, never a subsystem tag standing in for "somewhere in this member's remit." When in doubt, leave a class out; an unclassed finding is stamped with the classless fallback and counted as the unclassified recurrence signal rather than a draftable candidate.

<!-- gaia:maintainer-only:start -->
The schema lives at `.gaia/cli/src/schemas/finding-class.ts`, maintainer-only CLI source that never reaches an adopter clone. A bucket added there only reaches the shipped `harden-tally` command once the bundled binary is rebuilt (see step 8).
<!-- gaia:maintainer-only:end -->

### 7. Integrate the recurrence tally

The finding-recurrence tally reads each member's findings sidecar to feed `/gaia-harden`'s judge-the-form logic. If the new member's finding classes need routing guidance beyond the default (a mechanizable pattern routes to a deterministic check, a judgment call routes to a prose rule), add a short paragraph to `.claude/skills/gaia/references/harden.md` describing how the new bucket routes, alongside the existing oracle / holistic / rule / workflow / prose paragraphs.

<!-- gaia:maintainer-only:start -->
### 8. Regenerate the CLI binary

A finding-class schema change only reaches the shipped `harden-tally` command once the bundled adopter binary (`.gaia/cli/gaia`) is rebuilt from `.gaia/cli/src` and committed alongside the schema edit. Skipping this leaves the schema and the binary disagreeing about the valid vocabulary.

### 9. Release-exclude any test fixtures

A `scope: maintainer-only` member's agent file, and any fixtures or bats suites written to exercise it, belong in `.gaia/release-exclude` so the release scrub strips them from the adopter bundle. A `scope: adopter` member ships as-is and needs no exclusion entry.
<!-- gaia:maintainer-only:end -->

## Choices to make per member

- **Advisory vs. gating.** `push_fixes: true` lets the member self-heal (push a fix commit) as part of clearing its own marker; `push_fixes: false` makes it advisory-only, it reports and then clears or withholds, but never rewrites the tree. No auditor may self-heal the surface that runs auditors, regardless of its own `push_fixes` setting: a deterministic push gate refuses a self-heal touching any path in the one refusal set, `AUDIT_SELFHEAL_REFUSE_ERE` in `.claude/hooks/lib/audit-selfheal-paths.sh`. That set reaches past the workflow YAML, the roster, and the agent definitions that produce clearances to the tests, the whole `.github/` tree, the `.gaia/` machinery, `.claude/**`, `.specify/**`, `wiki/**`, and root build config. The ERE is the boundary; a prose list is a summary, so read the ERE.
- **`scope`.** `adopter` ships to every clone. `maintainer-only` entries sit inside `# gaia:maintainer-only` marker comments in both the roster and the builtin fallback, and the release scrub strips them, so an adopter's fallback roster only ever carries adopter-scope members.
- **Globs and roster disjointness.** Every claimant member's globs are matched first-match-wins over roster order; the default member's globs are a catch-all tier reached only once every claimant has failed to match. Two claimants must never claim overlapping territory, an overlap silently hands a path to whichever member the roster happens to list first. `.gaia/scripts/verify-audit-roster.sh` checks pairwise claimant-glob disjointness as glob languages (not just against files that happen to exist today), machinery registration, exactly one `default: true` member, the `code-audit-` name-prefix convention, and remit region parity (each member's agent definition carries exactly its roster globs, in roster order, inside a balanced marker pair). It ships to every clone; nothing gates a merge on it, so run it by hand after any roster change: `bash .gaia/scripts/verify-audit-roster.sh`, then `bash .gaia/scripts/write-audit-remits.sh` to repair a remit finding.

<!-- gaia:maintainer-only:start -->
## Local-gate checklist

Registering a member touches shared classifier and merge-gate machinery, not just the new agent file, so the bats suites guarding that machinery are the local gate for the change. Run all of these before merge:

- `bash .gaia/scripts/verify-audit-roster.sh`, the roster's own deterministic check (disjointness, machinery registration, exactly-one-default, the name-prefix convention, remit region parity).
- `.gaia/tests/hooks/audit-scope-lib.bats`, structural and invariant tests over the shared ownership classifier (`.claude/hooks/lib/audit-scope.sh`): golden ownership-resolution cases, the machinery-is-roster-claimed invariant, and scrub-marker survival.
- `.gaia/tests/hooks/audit-scope-routing-parity.bats`, the before/after routing-parity proof: it classifies every tracked file against a committed fixture snapshot and asserts each resolves to its prior owner, except the named set of paths a deliberate roster change is moving. A new member's globs belong in that named-exception set.
- `.gaia/tests/hooks/pr-merge-audit-check.bats`, tests over the local merge-gate deny-hook itself: the dispatched-member set it resolves, and the AND-aggregation across every dispatched member's own marker.

All four read live roster and machinery state, so a registration that only edits `.gaia/audit-ci.yml` and the agent file, without updating the fallback roster or the machinery lists in lockstep, is exactly the drift these checks exist to catch before CI does.
