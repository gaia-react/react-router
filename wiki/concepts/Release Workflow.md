# Release Workflow

How GAIA cuts a public release. Two surfaces — the template repo (`gaia-react/react-router`) and the bootstrapper (`gaia-react/create-gaia`) — ship on independent cadences.

> [!note] Audience
> The `/gaia-release` command is **maintainer-only** and stripped from distribution tarballs by `.gaia/release-exclude`. Adopters never see it. This page documents the flow so adopters understand what each GAIA release contains and why `/gaia-update` behaves the way it does.

## Primitives

| File                                  | Role                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.gaia/VERSION`                       | Plain `X.Y.Z`. Single source of truth for the installed version. Survives `/gaia-init`.                       |
| `.gaia/manifest.json`                 | Maps every GAIA-shipped file to a class (`owned` / `shared` / `wiki-owned`). Consumed by [[Update Workflow]]. |
| `.gaia/release-exclude`               | Tar-exclude format. Paths listed here are stripped from the release tarball.                                  |
| `.gaia/scripts/generate-manifest.mjs` | Maintainer-only. Walks `git ls-files` + classifier globs; writes `.gaia/manifest.json`.                       |
| `CHANGELOG.md`                        | Keep-a-Changelog format. `## [Unreleased]` at top; `/gaia-release` graduates it to a versioned section.       |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml`       | Tag-triggered (`v*.*.*`). Builds scrubbed tarball, creates GitHub Release with CHANGELOG excerpt.             |

## Versioning (SemVer)

- **Major** — breaking changes to skill/command API, Node bump, framework major upgrade, removed/renamed `.claude/` paths.
- **Minor** — new skills, commands, wiki concept pages; opt-in features.
- **Patch** — bugfixes, docs, in-range dependency bumps.

## Cutting a release

Run `/gaia-release` on a clean `main`. The command is a 12-step orchestrator:

1. Verify clean working tree + on `main`.
2. Ask: `patch` / `minor` / `major` (or explicit version).
3. Run `/audit-code` ([[Quality Gate]]). Stop on failure.
4. Bump `package.json` version + `.gaia/VERSION`.
5. Graduate `## [Unreleased]` to `## [vX.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD`; seed a new empty `## [Unreleased]`.
6. Overwrite `wiki/hot.md` with release-baseline content (so adopters clone a fresh slate).
7. Overwrite `wiki/log.md` with a single release-milestone entry (dev history lives in git).
8. Regenerate `.gaia/manifest.json` via the classifier script.
9. Commit: `chore(release): vX.Y.Z`.
10. Tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"`.
11. Confirm with user, then `git push origin main --tags`.
12. Report tag + expected GitHub Release URL.

The tag push triggers [`release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release.yml), which produces the scrubbed tarball.

## Tarball scrubbing

`release.yml` builds the tarball from `git ls-files` (not a raw `tar .`) and then subtracts `.gaia/release-exclude` patterns. Two-layer filter:

1. `git ls-files` already ignores anything in `.gitignore` — no `.DS_Store`, `node_modules`, build output, `.idea/`.
2. `.gaia/release-exclude` additionally strips maintainer-only content that _is_ tracked in git but shouldn't ship:
   - `.claude/commands/gaia-release.md`
   - `.gaia/release-exclude`, `.gaia/scripts/`
   - `wiki/entities/`, `wiki/meta/`
   - `.obsidian/workspace.json`
   - machine-local dirs: `.claude/{handoff,worktrees,agent-memory,audit}/`

Adopters who download the v1.0.0 tarball get 348 files, ~550 KB. The scrubbed `wiki/hot.md` + `wiki/log.md` contain only the release marker — none of GAIA's internal session cache.

## create-gaia bootstrapper

Separate repo, separate npm package (`create-gaia`). Zero runtime deps. When an adopter runs `npx create-gaia my-app`:

1. Resolves the target version (flag, or latest GitHub release).
2. Downloads the release tarball from `github.com/gaia-react/react-router/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/gaia-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz`.
3. Extracts into `my-app/`.
4. `git init` + initial commit (unless `--no-git`).
5. `pnpm install` (after `corepack enable pnpm`), unless `--no-install`. The scaffolded project pins pnpm via `packageManager` in `package.json`; corepack provisions the matching version transparently.
6. Prints welcome pointing at `/gaia-init`.

The CLI is deliberately thin — heavy lifting (i18n, branding strip, plugin install) happens inside Claude Code via `/gaia-init`. See the `create-gaia` repo for the implementation.
