# Release Workflow

How GAIA cuts a public release. Two surfaces (the template repo (`gaia-react/gaia`) and the bootstrapper (`gaia-react/create-gaia`)) ship on independent cadences.

> [!note] Audience
> Maintainer-only. This page is excluded from adopter distribution by `.gaia/release-exclude`. Adopter-facing background on what each release contains and how `/update-gaia` consumes it lives in [[Update Workflow]].

## Primitives

| File                                     | Role                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.gaia/VERSION`                          | Plain `X.Y.Z`. Single source of truth for the installed version. Survives `/gaia-init`.                       |
| `.gaia/manifest.json`                    | Maps every GAIA-shipped file to a class (`owned` / `shared` / `wiki-owned`). Consumed by [[Update Workflow]]. |
| `.gaia/release-exclude`                  | Tar-exclude format. Paths listed here are stripped from the release tarball.                                  |
| `gaia-maintainer release manifest` (CLI) | Maintainer-only. Walks `git ls-files` + classifier globs; writes `.gaia/manifest.json` only once every newly-shipping file has an explicit ship-or-withhold answer, or when the caller passes `--allow-undecided`. |
| `CHANGELOG.md`                           | Keep-a-Changelog format. `## [Unreleased]` at top; `/gaia-release` graduates it to a versioned section.       |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml`          | Tag-triggered (`v*.*.*`). Builds scrubbed tarball, creates GitHub Release with CHANGELOG excerpt.             |

## Versioning (SemVer)

- **Major**: breaking changes to skill/command API, Node bump, framework major upgrade, removed/renamed `.claude/` paths.
- **Minor**: new skills, commands, wiki concept pages; opt-in features.
- **Patch**: bugfixes, docs, in-range dependency bumps.

## Cutting a release

Run `/gaia-release` on a clean `main`. The command is a 15-step orchestrator:

1. Verify clean working tree + on `main`.
2. Verify `wiki/.state.json` is current: either `last_evaluated_sha == HEAD`, or the only drift commits are wiki-sync squash artifacts (subjects starting with `wiki:`). Substantive non-wiki drift STOPs the release; the wiki is stale and would ship out-of-date adopter docs. Maintainer runs `/gaia-wiki sync` first. The `wiki:`-prefix bypass exists because PR squash-merging always rewrites the SHA, so the standard flow (`/gaia-wiki sync` → merge → `/gaia-release`) leaves the state pointer one squash-commit behind even when content is current; without the bypass the gate is unsatisfiable. When a squash orphans `last_evaluated_sha` outright (`reachable:false`), `gaia wiki state` reports a hardcoded `commits_ahead:0`, a silent zero that would hide the un-evaluated window. Preflight catches this: it re-derives the drift over `suggested_base..HEAD`, the recovery baseline `gaia wiki state` resolves, and applies the same wiki-artifact classification, so an orphaned state still blocks on substantive drift instead of green-lighting on the zero. See [[Wiki Sync]].
3. Auto-determine bump by analyzing commits since last tag. `patch`/`minor` proceed automatically; `major` stops and asks.
4. Run the [[Quality Gate]]. Stop on failure.
5. Create `release/vX.Y.Z` branch.
6. Bump `package.json` + `.gaia/VERSION`.
7. Auto-draft a CHANGELOG block from `git log` since last release and present it for review; it is an aid, so fold anything the hand-written `## [Unreleased]` block is missing into that block by hand. Then graduate `## [Unreleased]` in place to `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` (no `v` prefix; `release.yml` extracts the section by the bare version), seeding a new empty `## [Unreleased]` above it. The hand-written entries are the released block; the drafted one is never written to the file, and an empty `## [Unreleased]` is refused rather than dated. The graduator also keeps the Keep-a-Changelog reference-link block current: it repoints the `[Unreleased]` compare link at the new version and inserts a `[X.Y.Z]` release-tag definition, deriving the repo base URL from the existing `[Unreleased]` link.
8. Overwrite `wiki/hot.md` with release-baseline content (so adopters clone a fresh slate).
9. Overwrite `wiki/log.md` with a single release-milestone entry (dev history lives in git).
10. Regenerate `.gaia/manifest.json` via `gaia-maintainer release manifest --allow-undecided`. The release path takes the escape hatch deliberately: a release cut from a tree containing a new file must not start failing.
11. Commit on the release branch: `chore(release): vX.Y.Z`. The pre-commit dance updates `wiki/.state.json`'s `last_evaluated_sha` to the new commit's own SHA via amend, so adopters' state files match their release commit on first scaffold.
12. Push branch, open PR via `gh`. The release PR is subject to the same CI gate (`Vitest and Playwright`, `Run Chromatic`) and `code-review-audit` merge handshake as any other PR; see [[PR Merge Workflow]]. `gh pr merge --merge --auto` is the normal path: base-branch protection rejects a plain `--merge`, and `--auto` lets GitHub complete the merge once checks pass.
13. Once the PR shows `MERGED`, pull `main`, tag the merge commit (`v<NEW_VERSION>`), push the tag.
14. Lockstep `create-gaia` and the website. The website update includes bumping three version constants, invoking the `release-notes` skill to generate the public changelog entry (`<version>.ts`) for the site, and overwriting the GitHub release body with adopter-facing notes rendered from that file via `render-release-md.mjs` (so the GitHub release and the website changelog stay in sync).
15. Lockstep the docs site (`../docs` sibling checkout): update the sidebar version constant and commit directly to `main`.

The tag push triggers [`release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release.yml), which produces the scrubbed tarball.

> [!note] Abbreviated SHAs are resolved before range queries
> `gaia wiki state --json` reports `state_sha` and `suggested_base` in short form. A caller that feeds either into a git range query (`<sha>..HEAD`) resolves it to a full SHA first via `git rev-parse --verify`; the `release preflight` subcommand does this before its wiki-sync drift scan (Step 2), for both the reachable `state_sha` range and the orphaned-recovery `suggested_base` range. Skipping the resolution makes the range query fail or silently return the wrong set on repos where the short SHA is ambiguous.

## Tarball scrubbing

`release.yml` builds the tarball in five phases:

1. **Stage**: drive the file set from `git ls-files` (not a raw `tar .`) and subtract `.gaia/release-exclude` patterns. `git ls-files` already ignores anything in `.gitignore` (no `.DS_Store`, `node_modules`, build output, `.idea/`); `.gaia/release-exclude` strips the tracked-but-maintainer-only content. The staging filter compiles `.gaia/release-exclude` into the anchored regexes it feeds to `grep -vE -f` by invoking `gaia-maintainer release exclude-regex`, the single compiler every release surface calls. Every discovery site reads the tracked set through `.gaia/scripts/list-tracked-paths.sh` rather than converting a NUL-delimited `git ls-files -z` stream straight back to newlines: a tracked path holding a literal newline is the one byte that conversion cannot represent, so the script refuses such a path outright (naming it with the newline rendered) instead of silently splitting it into two records. `rsync` materializes the include list into `/tmp/gaia-vX.Y.Z/`.
2. **Bundle-time scrub**: `gaia-maintainer release scrub /tmp/gaia-vX.Y.Z` applies the transforms in `.gaia/release-scrub.yml`: marker-delimited section strips and a leak-check pass that mirrors the `wiki-style.md` audit greps. Build fails closed on any leak. See [[Bundle-time Scrub]] for rationale.
3. **Runtime-deps verification**: `gaia-maintainer release runtime-deps --staging /tmp/gaia-vX.Y.Z` walks shipped shell scripts and verifies every explicit path constant resolves to a shipped path, an adopter-owned sentinel, or a runtime-allocated location. Catches the leak class scrubbing cannot see; runtime references survive lexical strip.
4. **Distribution test gate**: `bash .gaia/tests/distribution/run-all.sh` runs Layers 0+1+2 against an independently-staged tree (`build-staging.sh` re-runs the same `git ls-files` + scrub + runtime-deps phases above). Layer 0 confirms an adopter scaffold typechecks, lints, tests, and builds; Layer 1 confirms the bootstrap path survives in a PATH-stripped subshell; Layer 2 builds a Claude-in-Docker image and probes OAuth auth. The gate's `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` comes from GAIA's GitHub organization secrets; per-run cost is $0 on the maintainer's Claude Max subscription. If any scenario fails the release halts; the tarball is never built and `gh release create` never runs, so a broken release cannot publish.
5. **Tar**: `tar -czf gaia-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz -C /tmp gaia-vX.Y.Z`. The same release-exclude list drives `gaia-maintainer release manifest`, so the manifest never references files an adopter cannot have. The categories are spelled out in the next section.

The scrubbed `wiki/hot.md` + `wiki/log.md` contain only the release marker; none of GAIA's internal session cache.

Three staleness gates run ahead of the tarball build so a stale committed artifact cannot ship silently: a binary rebuild-freshness check byte-compares the committed `.gaia/cli/gaia`/`gaia-maintainer` against a fresh bundle from source; a templates freshness check snapshots committed `.gaia/cli/templates/` before the bundle, regenerates from source, and `diff -rq`s the two, since template content resolves at runtime via `import.meta.url` and never enters the bundled binary, so the byte-compare alone cannot catch a stale committed template; and `gaia-maintainer release scrub-wiki --check` compares committed `wiki/hot.md` / `wiki/log.md` against fresh-rendered release-clean output (dates normalized out of the comparison) and exits non-zero on drift without rendering anything, so a skipped scrub can no longer ship a stale wiki. Any gate failing halts the release before the tarball builds.

### Bundle-time enforcement

Marker-delimited maintainer-only blocks let the source repo carry content useful to maintainers (entity pages, internal cross-references, audit-decision rationale) without leaking into adopter scaffolds. Wrap a block in `<!-- gaia:maintainer-only:start -->` / `<!-- gaia:maintainer-only:end -->`; `gaia-maintainer release scrub` strips the block before tar.

New leak patterns become explicit `.gaia/release-scrub.yml` entries: visible, reviewable, deterministic.

## Distribution Boundary

The exclusion categories below are authoritative. `.gaia/release-exclude` is the executable copy; this section is the human-readable narrative. Anything **not** listed here ships in the adopter tarball and is classified in `.gaia/manifest.json`. Future audits that flag any of the listed paths as "missing from manifest" should consult this page first; the absence is intentional, not a bug.

### 1. Maintainer-only Claude commands

- `.claude/commands/gaia-release.md`: cuts releases of the GAIA template itself.

The other `/gaia-*` commands (`plan`, `handoff`, `pickup`, `audit`) are adopter-useful and DO ship.

### 2. Maintainer-only wiki content

- `wiki/entities/`: team and people pages specific to the GAIA project.
- `wiki/meta/`: lint and consolidate audit reports; references specific commits and dates.
- `wiki/.obsidian/workspace.json`: per-machine Obsidian layout state.
- `wiki/concepts/Release Workflow.md`: this page; documents GAIA administration, not adopter workflow.
- `wiki/decisions/Bundle-time Scrub.md`: ADR for the bundle-time enforcement primitives; describes maintainer release machinery.

Other wiki pages under `wiki/concepts/`, `wiki/decisions/`, `wiki/dependencies/`, `wiki/modules/`, `wiki/components/`, `wiki/flows/`, `wiki/sources/` ship as `wiki-owned` and are intended for adopter projects to extend.

### 3. Test harnesses and audit harnesses

- `.gaia/tests/`: bats / smoke harness invoked by maintainer CI.
- `.gaia/scripts/tests/`: bats suite for the shipped `.gaia/scripts/` helpers.
- `.github/audit/tests/`: bats suite for the shipped `.github/audit/` helpers (`check-trailer.sh`, `resolve-audit-base.sh`, `resolve-check-base.sh`).
- `.claude/rules/maintainers/`: maintainer-only rules (smoke-harness conventions, framework-distribution guidance); path-scoped or `@`-imported content that would dangle or misapply on an adopter install.
- `.specify/extensions/gaia/test/`: GAIA SPEC UAT runbooks.

The two bats suites cover GAIA-owned scripts that ship as `owned` code an adopter never edits, and their only runner (`.github/workflows/audit-ci-tests.yml`) is itself maintainer-only (category 9). The scripts are verified at maintainer CI time and reach adopters already-green, so the suites guard only maintainer changes and have no adopter-side use. The verified scripts ship; their verification rigs do not.

### 4. CLI maintainer source

Adopters receive only the bundled binary at `.gaia/cli/gaia` plus the runtime templates at `.gaia/cli/templates/`. Everything under `.gaia/cli/` else stays in the template repo:

- `.gaia/cli/src/`, `.gaia/cli/test-fixtures/`, `.gaia/cli/__tests__/`
- `.gaia/cli/package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `.gitignore`
- `.gaia/cli/node_modules/`, `.gaia/cli/dist/` (also gitignored, defense-in-depth)

Excluding the source prevents adopters from accidentally rebuilding the binary out from under themselves with a different toolchain.

`pnpm -C .gaia/cli bundle` builds two binaries from two entry points: `.gaia/cli/gaia` (adopter, no `release` namespace) and `.gaia/cli/gaia-maintainer` (maintainer-only, includes `release`). The maintainer binary is excluded from tarballs alongside the source. See [[CLI-Binary-Split]] for why the CLI ships as two binaries and how esbuild tree-shakes the release surface out of the adopter build.

### 5. Release-time maintainer tooling

- `.gaia/release-exclude`: this exclusion file itself.
- `.gaia/release-scrub.yml`: bundle-time scrub config consumed by `gaia-maintainer release scrub`. Adopters never run releases.

`.gaia/scripts/` ships to adopters: `check-updates.sh` is the background refresher the statusline invokes to populate `Run /update-deps` and `Run /update-gaia` indicators.

### 6. Maintainer dev-tool configs

- `.serena/`: Serena MCP project config. Initialized per-machine by `/setup-gaia` on the adopter's side; the template's copy isn't portable. Not in manifest so `/update-gaia` never tries to merge it.

### 7. Scratch and transient

- `.raw/`: scratchpad ingestion drop zone.
- `.gaia/local/`: per-machine state, CLI build cache (`.gaia/local/cache/`), the cost ledger (`.gaia/local/telemetry/`).
- `.gaia-backup/`, `.gaia-merge/`: `/gaia-init` backup and `/update-gaia` stage areas.

### 8. Per-machine Claude state

- `.claude/handoff/`, `.claude/worktrees/`, `.claude/agent-memory/`, `.claude/audit/`: generated at runtime under the user's clone; not template content.

### 9. Maintainer-only CI workflows

- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: cuts releases of the GAIA template itself, triggered by `v*.*.*` tags against `.gaia/VERSION`. Adopters never release GAIA, so the workflow is at best a silent passenger and at worst a CI failure if they accidentally tag with `v*`. Its tag-equality step reads `.gaia/VERSION` through the same `gaia_read_version` normalizer (`.claude/hooks/lib/gaia-version.sh`) the `GAIA-Audit` trailer and commit-status machinery uses, rather than a second, independently-written normalization of the same file; a caller-side idiom that trims differently than the shared function would agree with it only by accident and diverge silently later.
- `.github/workflows/cli-tests.yml`: runs `.gaia/cli/` typecheck and vitest, plus a PR-gated `Distribution harness (no-Docker)` job, path-filtered to the bundle inputs and the harness, that runs `.gaia/tests/distribution/run-all.sh` with no token so the Docker/secret scenarios self-skip and only Layers 0+1, the adopter-flow scenarios, and the deterministic marker-strip survival check gate the PR, plus an advisory `Shipped-surface leak check` job that runs `.gaia/tests/distribution/lib/build-staging.sh` and the marker-strip scenario on every PR with no path filter, since both read every tracked file `.gaia/release-exclude` does not withhold and no narrower allowlist describes that honestly. Adopters receive only the bundled binary at `.gaia/cli/gaia`, so there is nothing for the workflow to test on their side.
- `.github/workflows/pr-title.yml`: validates a PR's title against the conventional-commit vocabulary `gaia ci-check-subject` shares with the release version bump and the CHANGELOG draft, since a squash-merge turns the PR title into the commit subject those two (and the wiki classifier) read. The vocabulary it enforces is this repo's own; an adopter who wants the same gate wires it themselves, the subcommand itself ships.
- `.github/workflows/audit-ci-tests.yml`: runs the bats suite for `.github/audit/check-trailer.sh`. Adopters receive that script as GAIA-controlled (`owned`) code they never modify, so the suite only guards maintainer edits.
- `.github/workflows/distribution.yml`: runs the `.gaia/tests/distribution/` harness on a GitHub runner. Manual trigger only (`workflow_dispatch`); the maintainer's `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` org secret authenticates the in-container `claude` calls used by Layer 2 scenarios. Adopters never run distribution tests against their own scaffold, so the workflow is irrelevant on their side.
- `.github/workflows/forensics-triage.yml`: runs autonomous Claude Code triage against `gaia-forensics`-labeled issues on the upstream `gaia-react/gaia` repo, with helpers under `.github/forensics/` (also excluded). Adopters never triage GAIA's own issues, so neither the workflow nor its helpers belong on their clone.
- `.github/workflows/code-review-audit.yml`: runs the Code Audit Team gate in CI, posting the `GAIA-Audit` status a merge waits on. It installs on demand via `/setup-gaia` rather than shipping by default, so an adopter who has not enabled GAIA CI never carries a credential-less audit that would block every merge.
- `.github/workflows/shell-lint.yml`: runs shellcheck over GAIA's framework bash via the `.gaia/tests/shell-lint.sh` harness. Adopters run that bash as GAIA-controlled code they never author, so the linter guarding it has no adopter surface. The harness also parses every tracked `*.sh` with bash 3.2, the version stock macOS ships as `/bin/bash` and the version GAIA's own scripts declare support for, because shellcheck models bash 5's grammar and a construct that is a syntax error only on 3.2 clears every shellcheck pass; where no bash older than 4 exists (any Linux runner) that pass skips loudly rather than silently, and it fails rather than reporting clean when the interpreter is missing or unreadable. Because every Linux runner takes that skip, the workflow carries a second job on `macos-latest`, the one image in GAIA's CI whose `/bin/bash` is a real 3.2.57, and runs `shell-lint.sh --only bash32-parse` there: the pass-selection flag keeps that leg to the one pass whose verdict depends on the host's interpreter, since macOS runner minutes bill at 10x and every other pass duplicates the ubuntu leg. That leg asserts the image's `/bin/bash` major version before running, because inheriting the pass's exit-0 skip would leave it green having parsed nothing. It also folds in the repository's own pattern lints, each written for a class shellcheck cannot model at all: a shape that is legal bash and still wrong on the hosts this repo runs on, or a claim in one file that has to agree with another file. Which guards those are is not restated here. `.gaia/tests/shell-lint.sh`'s own header names every guard it folds in, beside the code that runs them, and each guard's own header states the class it flags and the surface it scans, which is the copy that cannot drift from the guard. Those surfaces are not uniform, and the workflow's name understates its reach: some of the folded guards read the `run:` bodies of workflow and composite-action YAML, which no `*.sh` glob sees.
- `.github/workflows/distribution-audit-pr.yml`: the per-PR distribution gate (see below). Runs `gaia-maintainer release manifest --check`; the binary and the manifest are maintainer-only, so the gate has no adopter surface.
- `.github/workflows/verify-required-checks.yml`: advisory drift check between the GAIA team's declared-required merge-blocking checks and the live branch ruleset's `required_status_checks`, via `.gaia/scripts/verify-required-checks.sh` (also excluded, category 1). Both the declared set and the ruleset it reads are the GAIA team's own, so the check has no adopter surface.

`tests.yml` and `chromatic.yml` DO ship; both are adopter-relevant. Their `paths-filter` allowlists are written without reference to maintainer-only paths so the filter stays meaningful on an adopter clone.

### 10. Maintainer-only health-audit infrastructure

- `.gaia/cli/health/`: health-audit taxonomy and per-cycle run state. Documents the issue classes prior independent audits found and the "decided / not findings" list so future audits don't re-litigate settled questions.
- `.gaia/cli/src/health/`: health-audit orchestrator + check primitives. Not imported by `.gaia/cli/src/index.ts`, so esbuild tree-shakes it out of the bundled `gaia` binary.

Adopters audit their own app via the standard `code-review-audit` agent under `.claude/agents/`; the GAIA-template-specific health audit is maintainer-only because its taxonomy and detections target the GAIA repo's surface, not an adopter project.

### 11. Maintainer-only project governance

Adopters use GAIA as a template via `npx create-gaia` to scaffold an independent project. Maintainers clone or fork the GAIA repo itself to contribute upstream. The GAIA template's governance documents describe GAIA, not the adopter's downstream project, and they ship empty consequences for adopters: a CONTRIBUTING file pointing at GAIA test harnesses, a CHANGELOG with GAIA's release history, a SUPPORTERS list of GAIA's supporters, an MIT LICENSE that pre-decides license choice, etc.

- `CHANGELOG.md`: GAIA's release history. Adopters write their own as they ship.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: GAIA's community standards. Adopters set their own (or none).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: how to contribute to GAIA. Adopter projects may not accept contributors at all.
- `LICENSE`: GAIA's MIT license. Adopters choose their own license.
- `README.md`: GAIA's marketing and architecture description. `/gaia-init` regenerates it from `.gaia/templates/README.md` (which DOES ship) substituting the project name.
- `SUPPORTERS.md`: list of GAIA's financial supporters. Adopters maintain their own if they want one.

The README template at `.gaia/templates/README.md` is the only governance-style file that ships, because `/gaia-init` consumes it as a strip-branding source.

### Adopter-owned sentinels

These ARE distributed but excluded from `.gaia/manifest.json` by the classifier (not by `.gaia/release-exclude`) because adopters take ownership at first install and `/update-gaia` must never touch them:

- `wiki/hot.md`, `wiki/log.md`: adopter's session cache and change ledger.
- `.gaia/VERSION`, `.gaia/manifest.json`: bumped only by `/update-gaia`.

The classifier is in `.gaia/cli/src/release/manifest.ts`, `ADOPTER_OWNED_SENTINELS` constant.

## Per-PR distribution gate

`.github/workflows/distribution-audit-pr.yml` enforces the manifest answer-contract at PR time. A feature PR that adds a git-tracked, non-release-excluded, classified file, one that would newly ship to adopters, must acknowledge it in `.gaia/manifest.json` before it merges, so the ship-or-withhold decision lands with the feature that creates the file rather than accumulating as an unanswered backlog left for a later, unrelated `/distribution-audit` run.

The gate runs `gaia-maintainer release manifest --check --json` and reads its `missing` array (every classified file the committed manifest has never acknowledged). It fails only on the intersection of `missing` with the files the PR touches: a pre-existing backlog inherited from earlier merges is not the current PR's to drain, so a PR is never blocked by a file it did not introduce. To clear a failure, run `/distribution-audit`, answer ship-or-withhold for each named file, and commit the regenerated manifest (and `.gaia/release-exclude` for any withheld file) to the branch.

The CI workflow and its local mirror, `.claude/hooks/distribution-preflight-check.sh`, derive the PR's changed-file list with `git diff --name-only -z --diff-filter=ACMR` piped through `tr '\0' '\n'`, NUL-delimited rather than newline-delimited. Git's default `core.quotePath` C-quotes any path carrying non-ASCII or control bytes, and `missing` arrives raw through `jq -r`; a quoted token would never intersect the raw set, so an unacknowledged file with such a path would pass both gates with no ship-or-withhold answer.

This is the PR-time complement to release Step 10, which regenerates the manifest with `--allow-undecided`: the release path must never start failing on a tree that carries a new file, so it takes the escape hatch by design, while the per-PR gate is where a newly-shipping file is actually answered.

The same workflow runs a second, independent condition: `.gaia/scripts/lint-shipped-issue-refs.sh` scans every shipped non-Markdown file (the committed manifest's file set, minus Markdown) for a bare `#NNN` issue or pull-request reference. `#NNN` resolves against whatever repository the reader is looking at, so an unqualified number in a file GAIA ships silently points an adopter at their own tracker; `.claude/rules/code-comments.md` requires the qualified `gaia-react/gaia#NNN` form on shipped files, and this lint is what makes that requirement checkable. It runs unfiltered because any shipped file can acquire a bare reference, and it composes with the manifest gate above: that gate already fails the PR until every newly-shipping file is acknowledged, so this lint's manifest-derived scan set is never missing a file the PR just added.

## create-gaia bootstrapper

Separate repo, separate npm package (`create-gaia`). Zero runtime deps. When an adopter runs `npx create-gaia@latest my-app`:

1. Resolves the target version (flag, or latest GitHub release).
2. Downloads the release tarball from `github.com/gaia-react/gaia/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/gaia-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz`.
3. Extracts into `my-app/`.
4. `git init` + initial commit (unless `--no-git`).
5. `pnpm install` (after `corepack enable pnpm`), unless `--no-install`. The scaffolded project pins pnpm via `packageManager` in `package.json`; corepack provisions the matching version transparently.
6. Prints welcome pointing at `/gaia-init`.

The CLI is deliberately thin; heavy lifting (i18n, branding strip, plugin install) happens inside Claude Code via `/gaia-init`. See the `create-gaia` repo for the implementation.

## Distribution boundary vs. source tree presence

A file's presence in the GAIA source tree (`gaia/.claude/commands/`, etc.) does **not** mean it ships to end users. The release pipeline filters via `.gaia/release-exclude` (and related classifiers). Maintainer-only tools live in the source tree intentionally and are excluded at release time.

**How to apply:** Before recommending or executing the removal of any file from `gaia/`, check `.gaia/release-exclude` and the release pipeline first. If the file is already excluded from distribution, leave it alone; the boundary is working. Only act when the file is actually leaking through to end users.

**Note:** `gaia/.claude/commands/health-audit.md` is a working maintainer tool already excluded from distribution by `.gaia/release-exclude`. Its presence in the source tree is not grounds for deletion. Check the exclusion list before removing any file.
