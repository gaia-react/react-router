## Execution model — READ FIRST

**Do not execute the playbook yourself in the current conversation.** Dispatch exactly one subagent via the `Agent` tool. The model depends on the mode. Each subagent runs in isolated context.

### Branch on `$ARGUMENTS`

**If `$ARGUMENTS` does NOT contain `--apply` → research mode**

Spawn one `Agent`:
- `subagent_type`: `"general-purpose"`
- `model`: `"opus"`
- `description`: `"Knowledge audit (research)"`
- `prompt`: the string below (literal, no paraphrasing):

  > `ultrathink.`
  >
  > `You are Stage 1 of a two-stage knowledge audit. Your job is to PRODUCE A REPORT ONLY — do not mutate any files outside .claude/audit/. A separate Sonnet agent will execute the actions later.`
  >
  > `Project root: /Users/stevensacks/Development/me/one-less-excuse`
  >
  > `Read .claude/commands/audit-knowledge.md and execute the "Research procedure" section (Steps 1–6). Write the report to .claude/audit/KNOWLEDGE-{YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM}.md using the exact "Report template" schema. Every action you propose must be mechanical — include every detail a literal-minded executor needs: absolute paths, line ranges, expected current content (verbatim snippet), replacement content (verbatim), and drift-check signals. No handwaving like "merge these" or "consolidate that".`

**If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--apply` → apply mode**

Spawn one `Agent`:
- `subagent_type`: `"general-purpose"`
- `model`: `"sonnet"`
- `description`: `"Knowledge audit (apply)"`
- `prompt`: the string below (literal):

  > `You are Stage 2 of a two-stage knowledge audit. Stage 1 (Opus) produced a report. Your job is to execute the unchecked actions MECHANICALLY — do not reason about whether an action is correct, do not expand scope, do not merge or split actions.`
  >
  > `Project root: /Users/stevensacks/Development/me/one-less-excuse`
  >
  > `Read .claude/commands/audit-knowledge.md and execute the "Apply procedure" section (Step 7). For every action: verify the expected-current-content drift signal matches; if it does, apply the change verbatim; if it does not, SKIP and note it in the final summary. Never improvise. Never invent replacements. If anything is ambiguous, skip.`

### After the subagent returns

Relay its final summary verbatim (report path + action counts, or done/skipped/failed counts). Do not re-do the work. Do not inline the report body.

## Research procedure

Audit the knowledge stores for duplication, stale entries, and auto-load bloat. **Wiki is the source of truth.** Memory is machine-local only. Auto-loaded files carry a token cost every session — keep them as pointers, push detail behind lazy wikilinks.

The report you produce is a **contract** to a Sonnet-level executor. Assume it can read, edit, and run bash, but will not reason about intent. Every action needs a literal before/after.

## Stores & load behavior

| Store | Path | Auto-loaded? |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Machine-local project memory | `~/.claude/projects/-Users-stevensacks-Development-me-one-less-excuse/memory/` | `MEMORY.md` (first 200 lines), individual entries on demand |
| Machine-local agent memory | `~/.claude/agent-memory/` | Per-agent, on demand |
| Project agent memory | `.claude/agent-memory/` | Per-agent, on demand |
| Project CLAUDE.md | root, `apps/web/`, `apps/ios/`, `wiki/` | Auto when cwd matches |
| Project rules | `.claude/rules/*.md` | Auto by `paths:` frontmatter match |
| Project commands | `.claude/commands/*.md` | On invocation only |
| Wiki hot cache | `wiki/hot.md` | Auto at session start |
| Wiki index | `wiki/index.md` | On demand |
| Wiki domain pages | `wiki/app/`, `wiki/brand/`, etc. | On demand |

## Step 0 — Prune old reports

Before writing the new report, self-maintain `.claude/audit/`:

- **Keep the newest 5 reports regardless of age** (floor — protects long gaps between runs).
- Of anything beyond the newest 5, **delete reports older than 30 days**.

```bash
if [ -d .claude/audit ]; then
  ls -t .claude/audit/KNOWLEDGE-*.md 2>/dev/null | tail -n +6 | while IFS= read -r f; do
    if [ -n "$(find "$f" -mtime +30 -print 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
      rm -- "$f"
    fi
  done
fi
```

Report the count pruned in the summary line at the end of the run (e.g. `pruned 2 stale reports`).

## Step 1 — Inventory

Run in parallel:

```bash
# Machine-local memory
find /Users/stevensacks/.claude/projects/-Users-stevensacks-Development-me-one-less-excuse/memory -type f -name "*.md"
find /Users/stevensacks/.claude/agent-memory -type f -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null

# Project-local
find .claude/agent-memory -type f -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null
find .claude/rules -type f -name "*.md"

# Wiki
find wiki -type f -name "*.md"

# Word counts for auto-loaded files
wc -w CLAUDE.md apps/web/CLAUDE.md apps/ios/CLAUDE.md wiki/CLAUDE.md wiki/hot.md .claude/rules/*.md
```

Record per file: path, word count, last-modified. Compute totals per store.

## Step 2 — Cross-store duplication

For every memory entry and every rules file, check whether the same fact lives in the wiki. Use `Grep` with 2–3 representative phrases from each entry. Classify each hit:

- **DUPLICATE** — fact already canonical in wiki → mark memory/rules entry for deletion
- **PROMOTE** — durable knowledge only in memory → propose moving to a specific wiki page (name the page)
- **KEEP-LOCAL** — genuinely machine-local (personal pref, machine path, unique dev env) → keep in memory
- **STALE** — references a file/branch/feature no longer present → mark for deletion

Rules-vs-wiki: a `.claude/rules/*.md` file is allowed to duplicate wiki content **only** if it exists to enforce auto-loading for a specific `paths:` glob. Otherwise it should link to the wiki page.

## Step 3 — Intra-wiki duplication

Scan `wiki/` for pages covering the same topic. For each cluster:

- Pick the most-complete page as canonical
- Propose merging the others into it (or converting them to redirects: a one-line page with `→ see [[Canonical]]`)
- Flag pages in `sources/` that duplicate content already synthesized in a domain page — `sources/` is archival, domain pages are active

## Step 4 — Auto-load budget

Targets (flag anything over):

| File | Budget | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `wiki/hot.md` | ≤200 words | Cache discipline per `wiki/hot.md` comment |
| `CLAUDE.md` (root) | ≤400 words | Routing + principles only |
| `apps/web/CLAUDE.md` | ≤400 words | Web-scoped routing |
| `apps/ios/CLAUDE.md` | ≤400 words | iOS-scoped routing |
| `wiki/CLAUDE.md` | ≤300 words | Wiki conventions only |
| Any single `.claude/rules/*.md` | ≤200 lines | Focused rule |

For each over-budget file, propose one of: inline facts → wiki, consolidate duplicated sections, or split into narrower files.

## Step 5 — Link-efficiency audit

In every auto-loaded file (CLAUDE.md hierarchy, `wiki/hot.md`, rules):

- **Describes instead of points** — flag passages that restate content already in a wiki page (e.g. "palette is #0A0A0A / #…" instead of "see [[Visual Identity]]"). Propose replacing with wikilink.
- **Broken wikilinks** — `Grep` every `[[Name]]` against `wiki/index.md`. Flag misses.
- **Dead paths** — verify every file path referenced in auto-loaded files still exists.
- **Inlined source excerpts** — flag wiki pages that inline raw text from `wiki/sources/` instead of linking.

## Step 6 — Report

Write `.claude/audit/KNOWLEDGE-{YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM}.md`. Create `.claude/audit/` if missing. Also snapshot `git status --short` into the report's frontmatter so Stage 2 can detect drift.

### Report template (strict schema — Stage 2 parses this)

```markdown
---
generated: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
generator: audit-knowledge stage-1 opus-ultrathink
project_root: /Users/stevensacks/Development/me/one-less-excuse
git_head: {commit hash}
git_status_snapshot: |
  {verbatim output of `git status --short` at research time}
---

# Knowledge Audit — {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}

## Summary
- Stores scanned: {N files, M words total}
- Cross-store duplicates: {X}
- Intra-wiki duplicates: {Y}
- Auto-load total: {Z words} (budget: {total budget})
- Over-budget files: {list}
- Stale entries: {count}
- Broken links: {count}

## Actions

Each action is a fenced YAML block prefixed with a checkbox line. Stage 2 flips the checkbox from `[ ]` to `[x]` on success, `[~]` on skip, `[!]` on failure. Every block MUST include `expect` (verbatim snippet of current target content) and where applicable `after` (verbatim replacement).

### Delete

- [ ] `delete-{nnn}`
  ```yaml
  type: delete
  path: {absolute path}
  reason: {one line — cite canonical wiki page + line range where the same fact lives}
  expect_sha256: {sha256 of the file's current content}
  ```

### Delete-entry (remove a specific block from a multi-entry file, e.g. a heading section in MEMORY.md)

- [ ] `delete-entry-{nnn}`
  ```yaml
  type: delete-entry
  path: {absolute path}
  expect: |
    {verbatim block to remove, including heading — must match exactly}
  reason: {…}
  ```

### Promote (memory → wiki)

- [ ] `promote-{nnn}`
  ```yaml
  type: promote
  source_path: {absolute path}
  source_expect_sha256: {sha256 of source content}
  target_page: {wiki path, e.g. wiki/app/dev-practices/Foo.md}
  target_action: {append_section | insert_after_heading | create_new}
  target_heading: {e.g. "## Bar" — only if insert_after_heading}
  target_expect: |
    {verbatim snippet at insertion point — omit for create_new}
  body: |
    {verbatim content to insert, frontmatter-ready if target_action=create_new}
  index_entry: {one-line addition to wiki/index.md, or null}
  log_entry: {one-line to prepend to wiki/log.md}
  delete_source_after: true
  ```

### Shrink / Convert (replace inline content with a wikilink)

- [ ] `shrink-{nnn}`
  ```yaml
  type: replace
  path: {absolute path}
  before: |
    {verbatim current block — must match byte-for-byte}
  after: |
    {verbatim replacement, typically a wikilink line}
  reason: {…}
  ```

### Merge (intra-wiki consolidation)

- [ ] `merge-{nnn}`
  ```yaml
  type: merge
  canonical: {wiki path}
  canonical_expect_sha256: {sha256}
  sources:
    - path: {wiki path}
      expect_sha256: {sha256}
      append_as: |
        {verbatim content to add to canonical}
      redirect_body: |
        ---
        type: redirect
        ---
        → see [[Canonical Name]]
  index_updates:
    - {line to change in wiki/index.md}
  log_entry: {one-line to prepend to wiki/log.md}
  ```

### Fix-link

- [ ] `fixlink-{nnn}`
  ```yaml
  type: replace
  path: {absolute path}
  before: |
    {verbatim line containing the broken link}
  after: |
    {verbatim corrected line, or empty string to delete the line}
  reason: {broken target, correct target}
  ```

## Ordering

Stage 2 must apply actions in this order: `fix-link` → `shrink` → `delete-entry` → `merge` → `promote` → `delete`. Rationale: shrinks never reference content that later gets merged; deletes come last so earlier pointers don't go stale.

## To apply
Run `/audit-knowledge --apply` within 24h.
```

End the research run by printing: report path, total actions per category, and the apply command.

## Step 7 — Apply procedure (Stage 2, Sonnet)

You are executing, not reasoning. Follow this loop exactly.

### Pre-flight

1. Find the newest `.claude/audit/KNOWLEDGE-*.md`. If none, or mtime >24h, stop and print `no fresh report — run /audit-knowledge first`.
2. Parse the report's frontmatter. Run `git rev-parse HEAD` — if it differs from `git_head` in the report, print a warning but continue. Run `git status --short` — any file that is currently dirty AND appears as a target in the report is marked `SKIP (dirty)` before any action runs.
3. Read the `## Ordering` section. Process actions in that order.

### Per-action loop

For each unchecked action block:

1. Verify drift signal:
   - If the action specifies `expect_sha256`: compute sha256 of the target file. If mismatch → mark `[~]` skipped, record reason `sha drift`, move on.
   - If the action specifies `before:` or `expect:` snippet: read the file and confirm the snippet appears verbatim. If missing → `[~]` skipped, `snippet drift`.
2. Apply the change using the exact operation:
   - `type: delete` → remove the file
   - `type: delete-entry` → read file, locate the `expect` block, remove it, write back
   - `type: promote` → perform the `target_action` (use Edit or Write as appropriate), then prepend `log_entry` to `wiki/log.md`, then append `index_entry` to the right section of `wiki/index.md`, then delete `source_path` if `delete_source_after: true`
   - `type: replace` → Edit with `old_string: before`, `new_string: after`. If `before` is not unique, prepend additional context from the file until unique.
   - `type: merge` → for each source: append `append_as` into canonical at its tail (or an explicit position if the action specifies one), then overwrite the source with `redirect_body`. Then prepend `log_entry` to `wiki/log.md`. Apply `index_updates` to `wiki/index.md`.
3. Flip the checkbox: `[ ]` → `[x]` on success, `[~]` on skip, `[!]` on error. Record the reason inline on the checkbox line.

### Post-flight

Print a final summary to stdout:

```
audit apply: {done}/{total} applied · {skipped} skipped · {failed} failed
diff footprint:
{git status --short}
next: review diff, commit if satisfied
```

## Guardrails

- Never delete a memory entry unless the action's `reason` cites a canonical wiki location. (Stage 1 must supply this; Stage 2 doesn't judge.)
- Never edit `wiki/log.md` anywhere except prepending a new line at the top.
- Never `git add` or `git commit` — leave changes in working tree for the human to review.
- Never improvise: if drift-check fails, skip and report. Do not search for the "right" target.
- Never merge two actions: each block is atomic.
- If an action targets a path that doesn't exist, mark `[!]` with `target missing` and continue.
