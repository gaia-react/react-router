Initialize a new project from the GAIA React template. The template already ships clean (no example code, no docs site, no auth). This command renames, strips GAIA-specific branding, configures i18n, installs Claude skills/plugins, and hands you a ready-to-build project.

## Step 0: Ensure pnpm is available

Tell the user: "Checking for pnpm…" then run:

```bash
if command -v corepack &>/dev/null; then
  corepack enable pnpm
else
  npm install -g pnpm
fi
```

If this fails, stop and report the error. `corepack enable pnpm` installs the pnpm version pinned in the `packageManager` field of `package.json`. If corepack is unavailable, fall back to a global npm install.

## Step 1: Install dependencies

The project was just created from the template — `node_modules/` does not exist yet. Install before doing anything else so later steps (typecheck, tests, build) can run.

Tell the user: "Installing dependencies — this may take a minute…" then run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

If install fails, stop and report the error. Do not continue.

Then run `/migrate` to bring all packages to their latest compatible versions before continuing. If `/migrate` reports anything as **skipped** with a reason, surface it so the user can investigate, but proceed. Note `/migrate` runs its own quality gate at the end — if it halts on a quality-gate failure or peer-dep error, stop here and surface the report to the user; do not silently continue.

## Step 2: Gather user input

Ask the user using AskUserQuestion (multiSelect where appropriate):

- What languages other than English to support (options: Japanese/ja, French/fr, Spanish/es, German/de, Other (comma-delimited list), None)
- Their GitHub username for CODEOWNERS (suggest `@username` format)
- The title of their project (default: "GAIA React App")

## Step 3: Strip GAIA-specific branding

Run in one shell:

```bash
rm -rf .github/FUNDING.yml .storybook/static/gaia-logo.png app/assets/images/gaia-logo.svg app/components/GaiaLogo
```

Replace the root `README.md` with the project-agnostic template and substitute the project title (use the value collected in Step 2; use Title Case):

```bash
cp .gaia/templates/README.md README.md
sed -i.bak 's/{{PROJECT_TITLE}}/<Project Title>/g' README.md && rm README.md.bak
```

The `{{PROJECT_TITLE}}` placeholder is the exact token in the template; the `sed -i.bak … && rm …bak` form is BSD/macOS-compatible and works on GNU sed as well.

Then edit `app/components/Header/index.tsx`:

- Remove the `GaiaLogo` import
- Replace `<GaiaLogo className="h-7 sm:h-9" role="img" />` with a text wordmark: `<span className="text-body text-xl font-bold">{t('meta.siteName')}</span>`

Then edit `.storybook/preview.ts`:

- Remove the `brandImage` import (if any)
- Remove the `BRAND` constant (if any)
- Remove any `...BRAND` spreads from `darkMode.dark` and `darkMode.light`

## Step 4: Update CODEOWNERS

Replace `.github/CODEOWNERS` contents with just the user's GitHub username (the whole file becomes a single line like `* @username`).

## Step 5: Configure languages

Note: by default only `en` and `ja` folders exist in `app/languages/`.

1. **Delete unneeded folders**: if Japanese not selected, `rm -rf app/languages/ja/`.
2. **Create new language folders**: for any selected language that doesn't exist (fr, es, de, etc.), mirror `app/languages/en/`:
   - `{lang}/index.ts` — same structure as en
   - `{lang}/common.ts` — translate values
   - `{lang}/errors.ts` — translate values
   - `{lang}/pages/index.ts` — same structure as en
   - `{lang}/pages/_index.ts` — translate values
   - `{lang}/pages/legal.ts` — translate values
3. **Update `app/languages/index.ts`**: import/export only `en` + selected languages. Update LANGUAGES array and Language type.
4. **Update `app/components/LanguageSelect/index.tsx`**: OPTIONS array to include only selected languages with native labels (English, 日本語, Français, Español, Deutsch).
5. **Update `.storybook/preview.ts`**: `initialGlobals.locales` to include only selected languages.
6. **Update `.playwright/e2e/language-switch.spec.ts`**: with the selected languages.

## Step 6: Rename the project

Use the project title from Step 2.

- `package.json` `"name"` field → kebab-case of project title (e.g. `"hello-world"`)
- `CLAUDE.md` — replace the `# GAIA React` heading with `# <Project Title>` (Title Case, e.g. `# Hello World`)
- `app/languages/en/pages/_index.ts` — update `meta.title`, `title`, and `heroTitle` to the project title
- `app/languages/en/common.ts` — update `meta.siteName` to the project title
- Do the same for every other `app/languages/<lang>/pages/_index.ts` and `common.ts` file (translate the title if appropriate, otherwise use the English project title)

## Step 7: Check `.env`

If a `.env` file does not exist, rename `.env.example` to `.env`. If `.env` already exists, leave it.

## Step 8: Verify the build

Run sequentially, stopping at the first failure:

```bash
pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test:ci && pnpm build
```

Fix any issues before moving on.

## Step 9: Claude configuration

If any install step fails, print the command so the user can run it manually.

### Install tools

GAIA bundles `tdd` and `playwright-cli` skills at `.claude/skills/` — they ship with the clone. Two external tools still need per-machine setup:

- [React Doctor](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor): `curl -fsSL https://react.doctor/install-skill.sh | bash`
  Installs the `react-doctor` skill to `~/.claude/skills/`. Scans the project for React-specific issues (47+ rules: security, performance, correctness, architecture). Auto-runs after code edits in a `CLAUDECODE` environment and is invoked by the `code-review-audit` agent pre-merge.
- [Playwright CLI](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli) binary: `npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest`
  Installs the global `playwright-cli` binary the bundled skill shells out to. Without it the skill's `allowed-tools: Bash(playwright-cli:*)` directive resolves to nothing. Used for E2E debugging and authoring Playwright specs with minimal token cost — each interaction is one shell call instead of a round-trip through an MCP session.

### Install plugins

- `claude plugin install typescript-lsp@claude-plugins-official`
- `claude plugin marketplace add AgriciDaniel/claude-obsidian`
- `claude plugin install claude-obsidian@claude-obsidian-marketplace`

### Wire the GAIA statusline

Add the project-scoped GAIA statusline to **project** `.claude/settings.json` so the user gets `/migrate` and `/gaia-update` hints automatically. The wrapper at `.gaia/statusline/gaia-statusline.sh` delegates the left-side render and only appends GAIA addons inside this project.

Make `.gaia/statusline/*.sh` executable: `chmod +x .gaia/statusline/*.sh` (idempotent — safe to run regardless).

Inspect `~/.claude/settings.json` for a top-level `statusLine` key, then branch:

#### Branch A — adopter has a custom global statusline (`statusLine` exists in `~/.claude/settings.json`)

Show the user a colored preview of the wrapped result by running:

```bash
GAIA_PREVIEW_TMP="$(mktemp -d)/gaia-example"
mkdir -p "$GAIA_PREVIEW_TMP" && git -C "$GAIA_PREVIEW_TMP" init -q -b feat/example-name \
  && git -C "$GAIA_PREVIEW_TMP" -c user.email=x@x -c user.name=x commit -q --allow-empty -m preview
mkdir -p .gaia/cache
cat > .gaia/cache/statusline-update-check.json <<'JSON'
{"checkedAt":9999999999,"outdatedCount":3,"gaiaCurrent":"1.0.0","gaiaLatest":"1.2.0","gaiaHasUpdate":true}
JSON
echo '{"workspace":{"current_dir":"'"$GAIA_PREVIEW_TMP"'"},"model":{"display_name":"Claude Opus 4.7"},"context_window":{"used_percentage":42}}' \
  | bash .gaia/statusline/gaia-statusline.sh; echo
rm -rf "$(dirname "$GAIA_PREVIEW_TMP")"
rm -f .gaia/cache/statusline-update-check.json
```

The Bash output renders with ANSI colors in the chat. The `gaia-example` / `feat/example-name` placeholders keep the preview stable regardless of the adopter's real cwd or branch — once wired, the live statusline reflects their actual project + branch. Tell the user: "GAIA addons will append to your existing global statusline only when Claude is launched in this project." Then write the project-level wrapper into `.claude/settings.json` (insert alphabetically):

```json
"statusLine": {
  "type": "command",
  "command": "bash .gaia/statusline/gaia-statusline.sh"
}
```

#### Branch B — adopter is on the default Claude statusline (no global `statusLine`)

Render the same colored preview as Branch A. Then `AskUserQuestion`:

> Install GAIA's recommended statusline (project + branch + model + context bar)?
>
> - **Globally** — show this layout in every project, plus GAIA addons inside GAIA projects (Recommended).
> - **Only in this GAIA project** — show only when Claude is launched here.
> - **Skip** — keep Claude's default; GAIA addons still append in this project.

Apply the answer:

- **Globally** → copy `.gaia/statusline/preferred-base.sh` to `~/.claude/preferred-base.sh`, `chmod +x` it, and write into `~/.claude/settings.json`:

  ```json
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "bash ~/.claude/preferred-base.sh"
  }
  ```

  (Insert alphabetically into the user-level JSON. Preserve any existing keys.)

- **Only in this GAIA project** → `touch .gaia/statusline/.use-vendored-base`. The sentinel is gitignored; the wrapper detects it and routes to the vendored base.

- **Skip** → no extra action.

In all three sub-cases, write the project-level wrapper into `.claude/settings.json` exactly as in Branch A.

## Step 10: Refresh the wiki

The template ships with a wiki shaped for the upstream GAIA project. Refresh the two files that encode "where we are right now" so the new project starts with a clean context:

### 9a. Overwrite `wiki/hot.md`

Replace the entire file with:

```md
---
type: meta
title: Hot Cache
updated: <TODAY_ISO>
---

# Recent Context

## Last Updated

<TODAY>. Project initialized via `/gaia-init`. Fresh slate.

## Active Threads

- None.
```

### 9b. Overwrite `wiki/log.md`

Replace the entire `wiki/log.md` file with the following content (the GAIA development log is irrelevant to the new project):

```md
---
type: meta
title: Log
status: active
created: <TODAY_ISO>
updated: <TODAY_ISO>
tags: [meta, log]
---

# Log

Append-only. New entries at the TOP.

## [<TODAY>] /gaia-init | project initialized

- Project name: <PROJECT_TITLE>
- Languages: en + <OTHER_LANGS>
- Removed: GAIA branding (FUNDING.yml, gaia-logo.svg/png, GaiaLogo component, Storybook BRAND)
- Installed: React Doctor, TDD, Playwright CLI skills; typescript-lsp, claude-obsidian plugins
```

## Step 11: Complete

1. Remove the `/init` interceptor — it protects the template's curated `CLAUDE.md` and is no longer needed once a project has been initialized:
   - Delete `.claude/hooks/intercept-init.sh`
   - Edit `.claude/settings.json`: from `hooks.UserPromptSubmit`, remove only the matcher entry whose inner `hooks[].command` is `.claude/hooks/intercept-init.sh`. Preserve any other entries the user may have added. If removing it leaves `UserPromptSubmit` as an empty array, also remove the `UserPromptSubmit` key itself.
2. Delete this command file so it can't be run again: `rm .claude/commands/gaia-init.md`
3. Output: "<Project Title> is ready for development. Restart Claude to pick up the new plugin and skill state."
