# PreToolUse Bash hook: deny `git commit` / `git push` that carry a hook
# bypass, so GAIA's commit-time deterministic floor (typecheck / lint / test,
# run by the Husky pre-commit hook) cannot be silently skipped.
#
# "Enforced, not advisory" applies to GAIA's own gate: a floor the agent can
# opt out of is advisory. This closes the commit/push layer. The apex merge
# gate (pr-merge-audit-check.sh) already holds and is untouched.
#
# Bypass tokens denied (on commit OR push, unless noted):
#   --no-verify                     skips client-side hooks
#   -n                              COMMIT ONLY (= --no-verify). On `push`, -n
#                                   means --dry-run and is harmless, never block it.
#   HUSKY=0 (or falsy HUSKY= prefix) disables Husky for the invocation
#   -c core.hooksPath=<path>        redirects hooks to a path with no floor
#
# Command-position anchoring: a token is only a bypass when it belongs to a
# real `git commit` / `git push` INVOCATION, i.e. `git` is the command word of
# a pipeline segment (start of command, after a `| & ; ( )` separator, or after
# an env-var prefix like `HUSKY=0`). Command TEXT that merely mentions the words
# (a grep pattern, an echo string, a path, an argument to another program such
# as `grep -n -e git commit file`) is not an invocation and never fires. Without
# this anchor the matcher fired on free-floating substrings: any command whose
# text contained `commit` plus a `-n` flag tripped, even when `git` was not the
# program being run.
#
# No carve-out is needed for GAIA's own legitimate --no-verify automation
# (audit-stamp trailer, wiki autocommit squash): those run as hook scripts
# (Stop / PreToolUse), not as Bash-tool calls, so a PreToolUse Bash hook never
# intercepts them. Do not "fix" the missing carve-out, there is no bug.
#
# Residual fail-closed edge: a bypass token written literally INSIDE a commit
# message (e.g. `git commit -m "use --no-verify"`) still over-blocks. That is
# the safe direction; rephrase the message. The unambiguous tokens
# (--no-verify, falsy HUSKY=, core.hooksPath=) also get a whole-command
# fail-closed safety net so segment-splitting on a shell metacharacter inside a
# message can never let a real bypass slip. Policy: wiki/decisions/Quality Gate.md
