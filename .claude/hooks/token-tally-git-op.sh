# worktree session is captured deterministically instead of depending on a
# session-scoped prose instruction. Gated on an active plan folder (a
# RUNNING sentinel whose branch matches the current branch) and keyed to
# that plan's feature. This hook only performs a side effect: it emits no
# permission decision, and every path it takes deliberately exits 0. The one
# way it can still block is a library it cannot parse, which the load comment
# below bounds.

# Source the shared resolver first, from this hook's own checkout via
# BASH_SOURCE (never the process cwd): the cheap gate below needs
# gaia_resolve_main_root before resolve_active_plan_dir (which defers its own
# copy of this same source into its body) ever runs. Then the plan-folder lib,
# off the same $_va_lib the verb-arming load above resolved.
# Sourcing is side-effect-free and near-free; the expensive work
# (token-tally.sh's transcript parse) still runs only past the gate.
#
# Three library loads, two treatments, decided by which side of the arming gate
# each one sits on. Under `set -e` a failed `.` abandons the shell ahead of the
# ERR trap at the top, and the two ways it fails do not cost the same. Bash
# cannot open the file: the shell exits 1, which a PreToolUse hook reports as an
# advisory, so the git operation proceeds and what is lost is the tally row plus
# a raw diagnostic on stderr. That is the 3.2.57 stock macOS ships as /bin/bash;
# 5.x reaches a trailing `||` arm instead. Bash opens the file but cannot parse
# it, a lib left holding conflict markers: the shell exits 2, which is the deny
# code, so the git operation is refused, including the commit that would repair
# the lib. That half dies on 3.2 even through an arm.
#
# The two loads here run only on an armed git commit/push, so they parse-check
# first. `bash -n` answers both questions in one call and subsumes an existence
# test. A lib that parses and then fails at source time lands on the trailing
# `|| true` on bash 5, which continues past the load; on 3.2 that failure
# abandons the shell ahead of the arm and the ERR trap takes it, exiting 0
# without the tally row. Non-blocking on both. What degrades in the trap's
# place for a lib that never loaded is the `type` check below for the
# plan-folder lib, and for the resolver the `|| exit 0` the cheap gate's
# gaia_resolve_main_root call already carries.
#
# The verb-arming load above runs before the gate, on every Bash tool call, so
# whatever guards it is paid on every call. It parse-checks anyway. The figure
# that once argued against that here, ~13ms of fork, did not survive
# re-measurement: on this machine `bash -n` on the real verb-arming.sh costs
# ~3.1ms on bash 3.2.57 and ~5.7ms on 5.3.15, over 200 forks, against a
# ~16-21ms hook process. A surcharge, not the doubling the old number implied,
# and cheap enough that the `|| true` arm this load used to carry is not worth
# its two costs: it closed the bash 5 half only, leaving an unparseable
# verb-arming.sh abandoning the shell on a stock 3.2, and it suppressed the
# syntax error that would name the broken file.
#
# The three errexit sibling hooks that load verb-arming.sh the same way carry
# the same check for the same measured reason (capture-gh-artifact.sh,
# post-findings-block-on-merge.sh, token-rollup-merge.sh).
#
# What the check does not reach, and the bound therefore covers TWO files
# beyond this one rather than one, because `bash -n` does not recurse into a
# sourced file: verb-arming.sh lazily sources TWO libs of its own, each behind
# an `-f` test with no parse check, and an unparseable copy of either still
# abandons a stock 3.2 shell at exit 2.
#
#   verb-arming-walk.sh, inside _gaia_va_view, needs a raw verb match.
#   repo-scope.sh, inside _gaia_va_first_command, needs only the lead-word
#   pre-filter, so it fires on any command sharing the verb's FIRST WORD.
#
# The second is much the wider of the two and the one to close first: measured
# on staged copies with repo-scope.sh holding conflict markers, a plain
# `git status` exits 2 on /bin/bash 3.2.57 and 0 on 5.3.15. Both loads live
# inside verb-arming.sh, so no consumer hook can guard either from out here.
# Tracked as its own issue rather than this one, because gaia-react/gaia#1556
# closes when this change merges and a pointer needs a live destination:
# gaia-react/gaia#1564.
