# PreToolUse Bash hook: BLOCK `gh pr merge` until every dispatched Code Audit
# Team member has cleared HEAD. AND-aggregator: resolves the diff's dispatched
# member set (.gaia/scripts/resolve-audit-members.sh) and requires each
# member's own clearance, one cleared member can no longer satisfy the gate
# while a co-dispatched member withholds.
#
# Zero-match (the whole diff is out of audit scope) or the resolver script
# being absent both fall through to the LEGACY single-signal gate: the marker/
# trailer/status/bypass logic below, unchanged, evaluated for
# code-audit-frontend alone. A non-empty dispatched set instead runs the
# member-aware gate further down: code-audit-frontend by the same signals,
# each SPECIALIZED member <m> by its own marker
# .gaia/local/audit/<digest>.<m>.ok (the sole clearance signal for maintainer
# members, which are local/advisory-only with no CI/trailer equivalent).
#
# Markers are keyed to each member's own CONTENT DIGEST (a sha256 over exactly
# the files that member owns plus the shared gate machinery, folding in the
# in-scope-but-ownerless paths for the default member), not the whole tree and
# not the commit. A marker attests that a member audited the CONTENT its
# digest covers: an out-of-glob change (a CHANGELOG line, a wiki edit) rotates
# no member's digest, so every existing marker keeps validating with zero
# re-dispatch; a change to a file a member owns rotates only that member's
# digest; a change to any gate-machinery file rotates every member's digest.
# code-audit-frontend's GAIA-Audit trailer stamp lands as an empty commit,
# which advances HEAD while leaving every blob byte-identical, so it rotates
# no digest either.
#
# code-audit-frontend / legacy-gate signals:
#
#   1. Local marker file at .gaia/local/audit/<frontend-digest>.ok, written by
#      the audit agent at the end of a clean local review.
#
#   2. GAIA-Audit trailer on HEAD's commit message, when the trailer's
#      version and frontend-digest fields both match a recomputed frontend
#      digest. Written by a local audit run via
#      .claude/hooks/audit-stamp-trailer.sh.
#
#   3. GAIA-Audit GitHub commit status on HEAD with state: success, description
#      "<version> <frontend-digest> <tree>", when both version and digest
#      match (the tree field is data only, never compared). CI stamps this
#      status instead of pushing an empty marker commit (pushing it would
#      re-trigger CI and leave the PR HEAD without check runs). A non-success
#      status (e.g. a local-mode stand-down's pending status on the same
#      context and SHA) is not a cleared signal even when its description
#      matches. Queried via `gh api` using GH_TOKEN or the ambient gh auth
#      session.
#
#   4. chore(deps) PR bypass: PR title matches `^chore\(deps(-dev)?\):`. The
#      /update-deps wrapper runs the full quality gate locally before
#      pushing, so the audit signal is implicit for this PR class. Mirrors
#      the same narrowing applied to code-review-audit.yml, tests.yml, and
#      chromatic.yml, all four surfaces skip together on chore(deps) PRs.
#
#   5. Out-of-scope bypass (legacy gate only, a non-empty dispatched set means
#      an in-scope file exists so this never applies there): every file the PR
#      changes lives on a surface outside audit scope, wiki, instruction files
#      (.claude / .specify), .gaia metadata, prose docs, and root-level
#      markdown. These mirror the surfaces code-review-audit.yml treats as out
#      of scope via its `has_source` check. Evaluated fail-closed: any in-scope
#      path (app/, test/, configs, .github/workflows/) makes the marker
#      mandatory again. An in-scope-but-ownerless path (a root Makefile,
#      public/**) is folded into the frontend member's digest input set, so a
#      stale marker computed for a prior digest never matches such a change
#      either; this bypass and that digest fold close the same band from two
#      directions.
#
#   6. Self-mod-only GAIA-update bypass: the only in-scope path the PR changes
#      is .github/workflows/code-review-audit.yml AND its committed bytes are a
#      verbatim re-render of the bundled template
#      (.gaia/cli/templates/workflows/code-review-audit.yml.tmpl), with every
#      other changed path out of scope. This is the self-mod-only case
#      /update-gaia Step 12 produces: it refreshes a stale audit workflow by
#      copying the release template verbatim, which makes CI self-mod-skip (no
#      stamp) and trips the in-scope guard of signal 5. The changed bytes are
#      GAIA's own template, not adopter code, so there is nothing to audit.
#
# Signals 1-4 and 6 prove an audit ran against this content (or that none is
# needed); signal 5 proves there is nothing in audit scope to review at all. A
# refusal artifact (.gaia/local/audit/<digest>[.<member>].refused) for a
# member's current digest is checked BEFORE any earned signal and is
# absolute: it denies regardless of a same-digest earned marker, for both
# code-audit-frontend and every specialized member.
#
# Without every dispatched member's clearance, the hook denies the gh pr merge
# call. To unblock:
#   1. Spawn the pending member's agent (code-audit-frontend for the default
#      member; the specialized member named in the deny reason otherwise) on
#      the current branch, OR for code-audit-frontend, push to the PR branch
#      and wait for CI's audit to stamp the GitHub commit status (CI ships no
#      specialized members).
#   2. Address any findings; commit and push.
#   3. Re-spawn the pending member's agent on the new HEAD; let it write its marker.
#   4. Retry gh pr merge.
#
# See wiki/concepts/PR Merge Workflow.md for the full contract.

# -e is intentionally omitted: we must not abort before writing the deny JSON.
# All error-prone commands are individually guarded (|| true, 2>/dev/null).

#
# One read rather than one per field. `gh` carries no request timeout of its
# own, so a second round-trip is a second OS-length stall on a blackholed

# four fields empty and each consumer takes its own no-answer path.
#
# The consumers are the two record-based bypasses, the legacy deny reason, and
# gate_cmd_names_the_record_pr, which every permit reaches through
# gate_permit_binds_to_named_pr. That last one is the reason this read is no

# All five variables are initialized HERE, at parent level, and that placement
# is load-bearing rather than cosmetic. This script runs under `set -uo
# pipefail`, and this function returns early before reaching any jq assignment
# on its two most common paths: no `gh` on PATH, and a `gh` that answers with
# nothing. A reader that dereferences $pr_record_head after either of those
# returns would trip `set -u` and kill the hook outright, so the gate would emit
# no JSON at all exactly where it owes a deny. Initializing inside the function
# body would not fix that; the early returns sit above it.

# base deserves to be trusted. Both bypasses below read $gate_trust,
# $gate_anchor and $gate_base and nothing else, so the two cannot drift.
#
# The resolution itself lives in the shared library
# (.claude/hooks/lib/audit-base-provenance.sh), the one place tree-wide that
# walks the supplied/record/default-branch ladder and the one definition of
# whether an empty range at a given trust level is decisive. This gate owns no
# copy of either, which is what keeps it from reaching a verdict the audit spawn
# oracle would contradict about the same base.
#
# Every git call runs against $tree_root, the ACTING tree resolved from cwd
# above. The derivation this replaced used a bare cwd-relative `git`; anchoring
# it makes explicit what was implicit, and matches the anchoring the member
# dispatch block below already uses.
#
# The supplied-base argument is ALWAYS the empty string, deliberately. No
# gate-side consumer accepts a base override and none may gain one: a
# caller-chosen base is a caller-chosen diff, and a fail-closed check whose diff
# the caller picks is not fail-closed. Do not add one here for symmetry with the
# spawn oracle, which is a dispatch-side consumer answering a different question.
#
# The answer comes from the pull request record, never from the environment. An
# exported base-ref variable would let a caller shrink a fail-closed check's
# diff until every remaining path looked out of scope; a PR's base ref is the
# branch it actually merges into, so scoping to it concedes nothing that merging
# the PR would not already concede. The shared resolver reads no environment
# variable naming a base branch on any path, so that refusal survives the move
# into it intact.
#
# Both checks below scope their diff to a merge base, and the branch that merge
# base is taken against decides what "this PR changes" means. The remote's
# advertised default is that branch only when the PR targets it: a PR stacked on
# another branch merges into THAT branch, and diffing against the default hands
# the check the base branch's own history instead, denying a bypass the PR had
# earned (gaia-react/gaia#1057).
#
# When the record's remote-tracking ref does not verify (no gh, no auth, no PR
# for this branch, network error, a base branch this checkout has never
# fetched), the resolver falls through to the advertised default and reports
# anchor `default-branch`. That is usually the wider diff but not always: a
# backport forked from current main and targeting an older maintenance branch
# merge-bases NEARER to HEAD against main than against its own base. It is the
# safe direction regardless, for a reason that does not rest on the geometry.
# Whatever the narrower answer drops sits on commits already merged to the
# default branch, which is where they were already audited.
#
# That fall-through describes the ref-does-not-verify case ONLY. A record ref
# that verifies but whose merge-base fails (unrelated histories, a shallow HEAD)
# does not fall through at all: the resolver answers `unresolvable` with an
# empty base, the guards below fire, and the gate denies. That is exactly the
# answer the derivation this replaced gave, and falling through there would hand
# this gate a resolved, wider base on a path where it previously refused
# outright.
#
# The memo is parent-level, and calling this function DIRECTLY (never inside a
# `$( )`) is what keeps it that way. The per-subshell memo it replaced existed
# only because both bypasses reached the base through a command substitution,
# which also made its two variables a coupled pair whose half-set state was the
# one combination that derivation existed to forbid. Both bypasses are invoked
# from the parent shell, so a direct call retires that hazard.
#
# Resolution stays LAZY, and this is the more expensive read of the two: on top
# of resolve_pr_record it derives the base's provenance and, in its callers,
# diffs the whole base-to-HEAD range. A cleared run now pays the record read
# (see gate_permit_binds_to_named_pr) but must not pay this one. Call it only
# from inside the two bypasses and the legacy deny reason, never at the top

# that placement is what makes it complete rather than merely correct. A
# clearance becomes a merge at exactly two places, the legacy single-signal
# gate and the AND-aggregator, and every route through both, the frontend
# signals and each specialized member's own marker alike, passes through one of
# them. Binding the three signals individually would leave the specialized
# members' markers reachable and unbound, and closing that would take more code
# than this does, not less. The record-based bypasses each keep their own call:
# they need the answer to decide whether they fire at all, this needs it to
# decide whether a decision to permit may stand, and the memo makes the second
# ask free.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS, since the comment this replaces treated the cost as decisive.
# The predicate reaches the network through resolve_pr_record, which the

# first need, so a merge naming no pull request still decides entirely from
# local files; the prescribed `gh pr merge <N>` spelling does name one and pays
# one memoized `gh pr view`. The reason that is affordable is that the command
# being gated is itself an unbounded network round-trip: a permit issued
# network-free is a permit for an operation that immediately makes its own
# network calls, so keeping this path local moves a stall a few milliseconds
# later rather than avoiding one. The read is unbounded exactly as every other

# gate_empty_is_decisive: may an EMPTY base-to-HEAD range clear this gate on its
# own? Five conjuncts, and the last four are why this is a named predicate
# rather than a bare call to the shared trust check.
#
# The trust conjunct is the shared library's, never a local copy: an empty range
# means "nothing left to audit" only when the base it was taken against is one
# this checkout could not have invented.
#
# The other four bind the relaxation to the pull-request record AND to the
# command being gated. This gate scopes its range to LOCAL HEAD, so without
# them a checkout sitting on a synced default branch, where `merge-base HEAD
# refs/remotes/origin/<default>` IS HEAD so the range holds zero files on remote
# provenance, would clear `gh pr merge <N>` for an arbitrary, entirely unaudited
# pull request. Requiring a `pr-record` anchor means the base was actually taken
# against the pull request's own recorded base branch; requiring HEAD to equal
# the record's head sha means this checkout is on the pull request the RECORD
# describes; and requiring the command's own reference to match the record's
# number means that pull request is the one being merged. On a synced default
# branch there is no pull request for the current branch, the record is empty,
# the anchor is `default-branch`, and this returns 1.
#
# The last conjunct reads the command through the shared scanner and denies on
# every abstention, so what it proves is bounded to the shapes that scanner
# reads exactly: the merge is the first command in the tool call, it carries no
# flag shape the scanner declines to model, no separator or comment puts a
# second command beside it, and every byte of it is in the small set a merge
# invocation needs, so no expansion of any spelling can run a second command.
# Anything else denies rather than being read approximately.
#
# The command-binding conjunct is NOT scoped to this arm, and it now IS a
# whole-gate invariant: no path through this gate clears a merge without
# establishing that the merge names the pull request the clearance is for. The
# arms that clear off the current-branch RECORD each ask at their own site, the
# chore(deps) and self-modification bypasses above and the non-empty arm of this
# function's own caller, because each needs the answer to decide whether it
# fires at all; keep it that way when adding a record-based arm, since the four
# reach that record by three different routes. The arms that clear off a
# CLEARANCE instead ask once, at the permit site, through
# gate_permit_binds_to_named_pr above; that function owns the reasoning for why
