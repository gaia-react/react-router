# PreToolUse Bash hook: deny dangerous `rm -rf` invocations.
#
# The `rm` command word is matched case-insensitively and through quote/backslash
# splitting, so `RM`, `r""m`, and `r\m` are all the command `rm`, exactly as bash
# resolves them. Flags are matched case-insensitively too.
#
# Denied targets:
#   - any command using --no-preserve-root
#   - rm -rf / (root)
#   - rm -rf $HOME, ${HOME}, ~, ~/, $HOME/...
#   - rm -rf .   (cwd, incl. $PWD)
#   - rm -rf *   (unscoped glob)
#   - rm -rf .*  (dotfile glob, incl. the .[!.]* / ..?* / {.,}* spellings)
#   - rm -rf .git
#   - rm -rf .claude (the Claude config: hooks, skills, agents, rules, settings)
#   - rm -rf node_modules (anywhere, must use pnpm clean / explicit path)
#
# Allowed (whitelist of safe scratch paths):
#   The safe-scratch set is declared in .gaia/state-registry.json's
#   `rm_whitelist` array, not spelled here, and read via
#   gaia_registry_rm_whitelist (.gaia/scripts/state-registry-lib.sh). See that
#   registry entry for the current list and its bare-vs-children-only shape.
#
# Each entry is whitelisted in both its relative and its absolute spelling, so
# `rm -rf /path/to/repo/dist` is allowed exactly as `rm -rf dist` is. The absolute
# form is what .claude/rules/shell-cwd.md steers every Bash call toward, and a guard
# that took only the relative one denied the form the rule prefers. The relative
# spelling needs no explicit arm: it is caught by no deny arm and reaches the
# catch-all allow. The absolute spelling is matched by `_rm_whitelisted_abs`
# against the registry-read list, once per invocation.
#
# Anything that does not match a denied pattern AND is not on the whitelist
# falls through (exit 0), this hook intentionally only blocks the well-known
# footguns; broader policy lives in settings.json permissions.
#
# SCOPE, read before trusting this guard. It text-matches target tokens, so it
# is porous by construction. Do not read the deny list above as a guarantee.
#
# A target the shell *computes* rather than spells is out of reach by design:
# command substitution (`rm -rf "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"`), an
# arbitrary variable holding a dangerous path, a relative escape
# (`rm -rf ../..`), and targets arriving via `xargs` all pass.
#
# Some *literally spelled* targets also pass. Treat the deny list as a floor,
# never a ceiling: it is not exhaustive, and for a heuristic text matcher
# completeness was never on offer.
#
# That incompleteness is the design, not a standing defect backlog. Do NOT file a
# porosity finding on the strength of a hypothesis, a hole reasoned to from the
# source, or an audit that enumerates shapes this guard does not catch. The supply
# of those is unbounded, each one costs real review, and this guard is explicitly
# the second layer behind settings.json permissions rather than the thing standing
# between anyone and disaster.
#
# A porosity finding requires a CONCRETE, RUNNABLE ARTIFACT, in one of two forms.
# Either an observed incident, a command that actually ran and should not have, or
# was actually denied and should not have been, with the transcript that shows it;
# or an executable reproduction, a failing test case against this hook that anyone
# can re-run. The second is if anything the stronger evidence, being deterministic
# and re-runnable rather than a one-time observation, and constructing commands
# against the hook is how these bugs actually get found; it is not the speculation
# this policy bars. What the bar excludes is the ARGUMENT with no artifact behind
# it. Bring either and it is worth fixing. Bring neither, and the correct response
# to "this guard could be evaded" is yes, it could.
#
# One such hole sits at the seam between the two halves. When the command word is
# not literally spelled (`$RMBIN`, an alias), no anchor matches, so the guard never
# identifies the command as an `rm` at all and every protected target passes: that
# is the computed-command case above. A target whose final path component is
# literally `rm` (`$RMBIN /usr/bin/rm -rf`) is the same hole, not a narrower one:
# it lands where the command word would sit, and the word is skipped by position.
# Nothing the deny list claims is lost, because a computed command word already
# carried `/`, `$HOME`, `.git`, `.claude`, and `node_modules` straight through.
#
# One direction is deliberately NOT repaired, and it looks like a bug. The guard
# denies commands that merely *mention* a flagged target in a quoted string, so
# `git commit -m "fix: rm -rf $HOME bypass"` is a false deny. Making a quoted
# `rm` not-a-command would fix that, and would also allow `bash -c "rm -rf /"`,
# `ssh host "rm -rf /"`, and `eval "rm -rf /"`. A text matcher cannot tell a
# quoted command from a quoted string; of the two failure directions the false
# deny is the safe one, so it stays. Deliver such text via `--body-file` / `-F`,
# or through a variable.
#
# The word FLAGGED is load-bearing there. Each segment is judged only when it
# carries its own `-r`/`-f`, so quoting a non-recursive `rm` is not a false deny
# even beside a real removal. That narrowing is exact rather than a partial repair
# of the above: it turns on the destructive flag, which the guard already required,
# and never on whether a token sits in command position, which it cannot know.
#
# `jq` is a hard dependency: without it the hook exits non-zero, which Claude
# Code treats as a non-blocking error, so the command proceeds unguarded
# (loudly, on stderr, never bricking the session).
#
# This is heuristic defense-in-depth behind settings.json permissions, not a
# sandbox. It is the second layer, never the first.
#
# LAYOUT. Everything above `main` is a definition: sourcing this file defines the
# helpers and constants and runs nothing. The executed body lives in `main`,
# called from the bottom only when the file is run rather than sourced, so a test
# can source the file and assert an internal helper directly instead of inferring
# it from an end-to-end verdict. `set -euo pipefail` therefore sits inside `main`,
# not at the top: at the top, a `source` would push those options onto the
# *caller's* shell. Nothing above `main` depends on them (function definitions do
# not execute, and the two assignments cannot fail), so the executed path still
# sets them before its first real command.

# Neutralize `;`, `&`, and `|` INSIDE quoted spans, rewriting each to a space.
#
# Both the short-circuit grep and the segment extraction below stop a segment at
# the first `;&|` byte, on the assumption that those bytes always terminate a
# command. Inside quotes they do not: they are ordinary characters in an operand.
# `rm -rf ";" $HOME` hands bash the argv [-rf] [;] [$HOME] and deletes home, while
# the unrepaired guard extracts only `rm -rf "`, never tokenizes `$HOME`, and
# allows it. This has to run before the short-circuit, not just before extraction:
# `rm ";" -rf $HOME` puts the quoted separator between `rm` and its flags, so the
# short-circuit misses too and the deny logic below never runs at all.
#
# A space is the right rewrite, not deletion and not a sentinel byte. The guard is
# already quote-blind at the token level (it strips quotes, then word-splits), so
# an extra token boundary inside a quoted string costs nothing, while any other
# filler would glue onto the token and break the anchored arms below: `rm -rf
# "$HOME;"` must still reach the $HOME arm, and with a space it does.
#
# Substituting rather than DELETING is also what lets the gate below skip this walk
# for any command whose raw text holds no `rm`. That skip is provably a no-op only
# because the walk writes each character back in its own position and the only byte
# it ever writes is a space, so it cannot close a gap and manufacture an `rm` the
# raw text did not already contain. A deletion could: a quoted `r;m` would close up
# into `rm`. That particular one is a phantom (bash reads `"r;m"` as a command
# literally named `r;m`, never as `rm`), so the divergence would surface as a false
# deny rather than a bypass, but the gate's justification is an equivalence proof
# and a deletion falsifies it. Do not switch this to a deletion without re-deriving
# that proof, or dropping the gate with it. The proof is asserted directly, on this
# function, by the position-preserving test cases covering it:
# a deletion fails them even though it changes no end-to-end verdict.
#
# This only ever WIDENS what gets inspected, so it can add denials and never
# remove one.
#
# It deliberately does NOT skip an `rm` that is itself inside quotes, which looks
# like the matching fix for this guard's false denies on prose that merely mentions
# a command (`git commit -m "fix: stop rm -rf $HOME from bypassing the guard"` is
# denied today, and that is annoying). Do not "fix" it: the same change allows
# `bash -c "rm -rf /"`, `ssh host "rm -rf /"`, and `eval "rm -rf /"`, which are real
# shapes this guard catches today. A text matcher cannot tell a quoted command from
# a quoted string, and of the two failure directions the false deny is the safe one.
# Work around it by delivering the text via `--body-file` / `-F`, or via a variable.
#
# Escaped quotes inside a quoted span are not tracked. The guard is a heuristic
# matcher; mis-tracking there misplaces a space, which fails safe.

# The `rm` command word, matched the way bash RESOLVES it rather than the way it
# is spelled. Bash removes quote and backslash bytes from a word before resolving
# it, so `r""m`, `"r"m`, `r"m"`, and `r\m` are all the command `rm`; and macOS
# ships a case-insensitive volume by default, so `/bin/RM` really is `/bin/rm` and
# `RM -rf ~` really deletes home.
#
# The target half of this guard already normalizes exactly this way (it strips
# quotes and backslashes per token, below). The command half has to agree, or a
# spelling of the WORD carries every protected target out through the matching
# sites in one move, before a single deny arm is reachable. The flag half was
# already case-tolerant (`[rRfF]`), which is what made the command half's
# case-sensitivity an oversight rather than a decision.
#
# The class is the three bytes bash's quote removal drops: backslash, double
# quote, single quote. The backslash leads it deliberately. A POSIX bracket
# expression takes a backslash literally, so the set is the same either way, but a
# TRAILING one would sit against the closing `]` and read as an escape of it to
# anything that does not implement that rule, leaving the bracket unterminated.
# Leading, the worst case is that a stricter engine reads `\"` as an escaped quote
# and the set quietly loses the backslash: the pattern stays well-formed and only
# `r\m` degrades to today's verdict.
#
# All THREE `rm`-matching sites share this rule: the two greps below, which take
# it as an ERE, and the walk gate immediately below, which needs the glob spelling
# of it. Anything that widens one has to widen the others in step, so the greps
# take it from one definition and the gate's comment states the tie explicitly.

# The destructive flag, shared by the short-circuit probe and the segment
# extraction below so the two cannot drift. They have to agree: the probe decides
# whether to look at the command at all, and the extraction decides which segments
# get judged. When only the probe carried this clause, a flag anywhere in the
# command licensed judging every `rm` segment in it, including segments that were
# not removals at all.
#
# A flag is its own shell WORD, and requiring that is what separates `-rf` from a
# hyphenated path component. `-[a-zA-Z]*[rRfF]` alone matches the `-matcher` inside
# `c-text-matcher-guards`, so a flagless `rm /path/to/c-text-matcher-guards/x`
# read as a destructive `rm -r` on the strength of a directory NAME. That is not a
# hypothetical shape: `-matcher`, `-perf`, `-refactor`, and `-user` are all
# ordinary branch and directory names, and an agent that cannot delete its own
# scratch routes around the guard entirely.
#
# The boundary is a separate piece from the flag because it has to sit INSIDE the
# segment's own `[^;&|]*` run rather than in front of it. The anchor above already
# consumes the whitespace after the command word, so a boundary byte demanded
# ahead of the flag would have nothing left to match in `rm -rf /`.
#
# Quote and backslash bytes count as boundaries alongside whitespace. Bash drops
# them during quote removal, so `rm "-rf" /` is a genuine flag and has to stay
# denied; this is the same three-byte class the command word above matches through,
