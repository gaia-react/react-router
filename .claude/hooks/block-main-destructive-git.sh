# GAIA's own known-safe CI-install commit directly on main (main is not yet a
# collaboration surface and the commit has nothing to audit). setup-gaia
# creates this machine-local sentinel around that single commit+push and
# removes it right after, suspending the PR-only policy only for that window.
# The sentinel lives in .gaia/local/ (gitignored), so it never rides along in a
# teammate's clone: a fresh checkout always has this hook fully enforcing. The
# resting state is ON; this is the one explicit, temporary exception.
#
# Self-healing freshness bound: the sentinel is honored only while its mtime is
# within the last 10 minutes. The finalize commit+push completes in seconds, so
# a live setup is always inside that window; a sentinel a crashed or killed
# setup left behind goes stale on its own and enforcement resumes WITHOUT
# waiting for a /setup-gaia re-run to remove it. `find` returning empty (stale,
# missing, or unreadable) falls through to full enforcement, fail-closed.
