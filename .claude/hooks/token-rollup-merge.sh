# Shared arming decision; see .claude/hooks/lib/verb-arming.sh. A quoted verb
# inside prose still arms here, fail-closed, with no safe narrowing.
#
# This load runs before the arming gate, on every Bash tool call, so whatever
# guards it is paid on every call. Measured on this machine rather than assumed:
# `bash -n` on the real verb-arming.sh costs ~3.1ms on bash 3.2.57 and ~5.7ms
# on 5.3.15, over 200 forks, against a ~16-21ms hook process. A surcharge, not
# a doubling, and worth paying. That per-fork figure is the one to size a fifth
# parse-checked hook off: no end-to-end per-hook delta is quoted here because
# it could not be measured on this machine, and the header of
# verb-arming-cost.bats records why.
#
# The cheaper `{ . lib || true; }` arm was the first spelling here and is not
# enough. It closes the bash 5 half only: under `set -e` an unparseable
# verb-arming.sh still abandons the shell ahead of the arm on a stock 3.2 at
# exit 2, and it suppresses the syntax error that would name the broken file,
# so what survives is a denial with no stated reason. The parse check removes
# both, which is why the cost above is spent here.
#
# What the check does not reach, because `bash -n` does not recurse into a
# sourced file: verb-arming.sh lazily sources TWO libs of its own, each behind
# an `-f` test with no parse check, and an unparseable copy of either still
# abandons a stock 3.2 shell at exit 2.
#
#   verb-arming-walk.sh, inside _gaia_va_view, needs a raw verb match.
#   repo-scope.sh, inside _gaia_va_first_command, needs only the lead-word
#   pre-filter, so it fires on any command sharing the verb's FIRST WORD.
#
# The second is much the wider of the two and the one to close first: measured
# on staged copies with repo-scope.sh holding conflict markers, a plain
# `git status` exits 2 on /bin/bash 3.2.57 and 0 on 5.3.15. Both loads live
# inside verb-arming.sh, so no consumer hook can guard either from out here.
# Tracked as its own issue rather than this one, because gaia-react/gaia#1556
# closes when this change merges and a pointer needs a live destination:
# gaia-react/gaia#1564.

# trap never reached. `bash -n` subsumes the existence test; the `type` check

# Rooted at this file's own directory, never at the process working directory:

# it. Standing the render down is the same silent degrade every other arm here
