# reads, so plan execution can carry the pull request its own commit-triggered
# rows have no agent in the loop to report. Every other cost-recording surface
# (the five prose maintenance commands and the /gaia-wiki chain) binds its
# artifact by direct pass-through instead and reads no breadcrumb; see
# .gaia/scripts/gh-artifact-lib.sh for the full rationale.

# Uses the shared arming decision, the same one token-rollup-merge.sh uses
# (.claude/hooks/lib/verb-arming.sh). Deliberately does NOT match `gh issue
# create`: see gh-artifact-lib.sh for why. A quoted verb inside prose still
# arms here, fail-closed, with no safe narrowing.
#
# This load runs before the arming gate, on every Bash tool call, so whatever
# guards it is paid on every call. Measured on this machine rather than assumed:
# `bash -n` on the real verb-arming.sh costs ~3.1ms on bash 3.2.57 and ~5.7ms
# on 5.3.15, over 200 forks, against a ~16-21ms hook process. A surcharge, not
# a doubling, and worth paying. That per-fork figure is the one to size a fifth
# parse-checked hook off: no end-to-end per-hook delta is quoted here because
# it could not be measured on this machine, and the header of
# verb-arming-cost.bats records why.
#
# The cheaper `{ . lib || true; }` arm was the first spelling here and is not
# enough. It closes the bash 5 half only: under `set -e` an unparseable
# verb-arming.sh still abandons the shell ahead of the arm on a stock 3.2 at
# exit 2, and it suppresses the syntax error that would name the broken file,
# so what survives is a denial with no stated reason. The parse check removes
# both, which is why the cost above is spent here.
#
# What the check does not reach, because `bash -n` does not recurse into a
# sourced file: verb-arming.sh lazily sources TWO libs of its own, each behind
# an `-f` test with no parse check, and an unparseable copy of either still
# abandons a stock 3.2 shell at exit 2.
#
#   verb-arming-walk.sh, inside _gaia_va_view, needs a raw verb match.
#   repo-scope.sh, inside _gaia_va_first_command, needs only the lead-word
#   pre-filter, so it fires on any command sharing the verb's FIRST WORD.
#
# The second is much the wider of the two and the one to close first: measured
# on staged copies with repo-scope.sh holding conflict markers, a plain
# `git status` exits 2 on /bin/bash 3.2.57 and 0 on 5.3.15. Both loads live
# inside verb-arming.sh, so no consumer hook can guard either from out here.
# Tracked as its own issue rather than this one, because gaia-react/gaia#1556
# closes when this change merges and a pointer needs a live destination:
# gaia-react/gaia#1564.

# Past the arming gate, so this load parse-checks: `bash -n` answers both
# "does it open" and "does it parse" in one call and subsumes the existence
# test the trailing `|| exit 0` could not deliver. Under `set -e` a failed `.`
# abandons the shell ahead of that arm: a file bash cannot open exits 1, losing
# the breadcrumb, and one it cannot parse exits 2. Both halves are 3.2-only
# here, because the arm this replaced was `|| exit 0` and bash 5 reaches it for
# an unparseable lib exactly as for a missing one; measured 2 and 0 on 3.2.57
# and 5.3.15. Only a bare `.` with no arm dies on both shells, which is the
# shape the verb-arming load above carried and this one did not. That is why
# the conflict-marker case for this load is pinned to /bin/bash and ships no
# unpinned counterpart. This is PostToolUse, so neither exit refuses the
# `gh pr create` that already ran; both contradict the "degrade silently,
# always exit 0" contract in this file's header. What degrades in the arm's
# place is the `type` check.
#
# Rooted through the location resolved for the arming load above rather than
# the process working directory: the parse check answers false for a library it
# cannot see, and the `type` degrade below reads that as an unusable lib.
# Three levels up, not two: $_va_lib is the `lib` DIRECTORY
# (<root>/.claude/hooks/lib), so the repository root is ../../.. from it.
# Empty when the rooting above failed, and guarded rather than defaulted to a
# bare `.claude/hooks/lib`: that default resolves against the process working
# directory, so the one branch where the rooting fails would revert to exactly
# the resolution this rooting exists to remove, indistinguishably from an
# absent library. Same shape as the arming load above.
