# PreToolUse Bash hook: DENY `gh pr merge` when an emergent test the PR changed
# has no worthiness-ledger line matching its CURRENT content. This is the
# merge-time half of the worthiness audit: the evaluator
# (.claude/agents/worthiness-evaluator.md) judges each emergent test and the tdd
# skill appends one ledger line per judged test
# (.gaia/scripts/audit-ledger/append-worthiness.mjs); this hook enforces at merge
# that such a line exists for the content being merged. It sits ALONGSIDE
# pr-merge-audit-check.sh: both gate `gh pr merge` and deny independently.
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES (and what it does NOT). The check is a LEDGER LOOKUP + a
# SIGNAL RECOMPUTE; it never re-runs tests and never re-runs the evaluator. A
# present, signal-matching ledger line proves only that the test-identity
# extractor RAN over the test's current content and a verdict was recorded
# against that exact content. It does NOT prove a human (or an LLM) applied
# judgement: a scripted rubber-stamp (run extract-test-signals.mjs, append a
# `keep` for every emitted signal) mints every matching line at near-zero cost
# and is the cost-minimizing path through this gate. The judgement guarantee
# rests on the human PR rollup, NOT on the mere presence of a line. The gate
# checks PRESENCE + signal match ONLY; it never reads the keep/fix/delete verdict
# at all (that keeps the verdict advisory).
#
# This gate does NOT re-check static test-honesty lint. That invariant is owned,
# once, by its own gate: the Quality Gate at commit (eslint --max-warnings=0) and
# CI lint at PR. A file carrying a honesty-lint error cannot be committed or
# merged, so re-checking it here would double-gate an invariant another system
# already enforces ruthlessly. The worthiness gate owns presence; lint owns
# honesty.
#
# SCOPE. The gate scopes to the EMERGENT test files THIS PR changed (git diff
# against the merge base with the default branch), not the whole repo's emergent
# tests. Emergent membership is decided by the determinism classifier
# (.gaia/scripts/classifier/classify-determinism.mjs): a changed test file whose
# classifier verdict is `emergent` is in scope; a `.ts` test under
# app/components/** that the classifier proves deterministic is RED-gated, not
# worthiness-gated, and is excluded. When ZERO emergent test files changed, the
# gate is a NO-OP and allows the merge.
#
# COST/LATENCY. The recompute is O(emergent test files changed in the PR): each
# in-scope file is fed through the signal helper once. Wall-clock therefore
# scales with the emergent test count; this axis is not made sub-linear.
#
# Fail-open vs fail-closed (threat model: a cooperative-but-fallible agent):
#   - jq / git / node / the RED-ledger lib / the classifier unavailable -> exit 0
#     (allow). Sibling-hook posture; the gate enforces only where its tooling
#     answers.
#   - a changed emergent test file the signal helper cannot parse (mid-edit
#     syntax error) -> that file is skipped, never denied. Fail-open.
#   - the deny path is fail-closed ONLY for the clean case: a parseable in-scope
#     emergent test whose CURRENT signal has no matching worthiness-ledger line.
#
# The signal covers the test's comment-free content, so a comment reword
# leaves it unchanged and a matching line still counts. Stale-signal lines (a
# line written before a later edit to what the test executes) carry the old
# signal and so never match the recomputed current signal -> rejected, exactly
# like the RED gate's stale-signal invalidation.
#
# See wiki/decisions/Worthiness Presence Gate.md for the full contract.

# -e is intentionally omitted: we must not abort before writing the deny JSON.
# All error-prone commands are individually guarded (|| true, 2>/dev/null).
