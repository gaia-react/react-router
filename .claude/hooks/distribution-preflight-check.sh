# PreToolUse Bash hook: DENY `gh pr create` when a file this branch newly ships
# has no answer in the committed .gaia/manifest.json, so the maintainer learns
# it before pushing instead of after the "Distribution Audit" CI job goes red.
#
# This is a LOCAL PRE-FLIGHT for .github/workflows/distribution-audit-pr.yml and
# deliberately enforces the same rule in two places. That duplication is the
# point, not an oversight:
#
#   CI-only feedback is too late to be cheap. The CI job can only speak after a
#   push, a PR, and a runner boot; by then the maintainer has context-switched
#   away and pays a full round trip to answer a question the working tree could
#   have answered instantly. This is the same reasoning that makes the pre-merge
#   Code Audit Team default to a LOCAL producer rather than CI (see
#   wiki/concepts/PR Merge Workflow.md, "Marker-first"): the deterministic gate
#   stays authoritative in CI, and a local copy of it buys fast feedback.
#
#   CI remains the authority. This hook is advisory-in-effect: it fails open on
#   every uncertainty (see below), so it can only ever be a cheaper way to find
#   out what CI would have told you. It cannot pass something CI would fail,
#   because it never writes a marker or clears any gate; it only denies earlier.
#
# Recorded here rather than left implicit because an unexplained two-place rule
# reads to a later audit as accidental drift. See wiki/decisions/Deliberate
# Configuration Asymmetries.md for the sibling cases.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT MIRROR: the CI gate has two further independent failure
# conditions, region-declaration drift and the shipped-issue-reference lint, and
# this hook evaluates neither. Both omissions are deliberate, and for the same
# reason. The claim above is that this hook is only ever a cheaper way to find
# out what CI would have told you, and that holds only while every arm here
# answers from the same state CI audits:
#
#   The missing arm qualifies, and the intersection is precisely what makes it
#   qualify. The file map behind `missing` is a git ls-files walk, which reads
#   the INDEX, so a staged-but-uncommitted `git add` of a new file does reach
#   `missing` on its own. Intersecting it with this branch's committed changed
#   set (the three-dot diff below) is what drops that staged-only path, leaving
#   the arm denying on committed state, the same state CI audits. Do not read
#   the ls-files walk as confining the arm by itself, and do not drop the
#   intersection on that belief.
#
#   Region drift does not qualify. The checker reports it as `.regionDrift` in
#   the same --json report parsed below, and builds it by reading each
#   shipped file's CONTENT off disk and diffing the marker-bearing paths it
#   finds against the committed manifest's declaration, so an uncommitted edit
#   that adds or removes a marker pair moves it. CI also leaves it unscoped on
#   purpose, so a stale declaration cannot slip through on a PR that touches no
#   declared path. Evaluated here, it would be the one arm that denies what CI
#   would pass, on a working tree the PR never contains, and its remedy text
#   would tell the maintainer to regenerate a manifest that is not stale.
#   Narrowing it to the changed set instead would enforce a different rule than
#   CI's, which that workflow's own inline comment rules out.
#
#   The issue-reference lint does not qualify either, and it fails the same
#   test. It reads each shipped file's CONTENT off disk, so an uncommitted edit
#   that adds or removes a bare reference moves its verdict, and it is scoped to
#   the whole shipped set rather than the changed one for the same reason region
#   drift is. Evaluated here it would deny on a working tree the PR never
#   contains, which is exactly what the guarantee below forbids.
#
# So both stay CI-only and surface as a red check after the push. That gap in
# local coverage is the accepted price of the guarantee that a deny here always
# means a red check there.
#
# WHY `gh pr create` AND NOT `git push`: push-time would catch this one round
# earlier, but it fires on every work-in-progress push to a branch that has no
# PR and may never get one, where an unanswered manifest entry is not yet a
# question anybody owes an answer to. PR-create is the first moment the shipping
# surface is actually being proposed, so it is the first moment the question is
# real.
#
# ADOPTER POSTURE: neither this script nor its registration reaches an adopter
# clone. The script is release-excluded, and the registration is committed in
# .claude/settings.json but stripped at bundle time. Both halves are required
# and neither is sufficient alone:
#
#   - The script cannot ship. It names `.gaia/cli/gaia-maintainer` and
#     `.github/workflows/distribution-audit-pr.yml`, both release-excluded, and
#     `.claude/**` is in scope for the `maintainer-paths` and
#     `excluded-workflow-ref` leak-checks, so a shipped copy fails the release
#     build outright. Independently of that, an adopter-side agent reading it
#     would infer a release manifest, a distribution boundary, and a
#     /distribution-audit command that do not exist on their clone, and act on
#     that inference.
#
#   - The registration must not survive into an adopter bundle.
#     .claude/settings.json is manifest class `shared` and reaches adopter
#     clones, so a registration that shipped would point every adopter's
#     PreToolUse/Bash chain at a file they do not have. The `json-strip-array-
#     element` rule in .gaia/release-scrub.yml removes exactly this element
#     (selector `hooks.PreToolUse[].hooks[]` matching this script's command)
#     before tar, so the committed registration never reaches an adopter.
#
# Committing the registration is what makes the gate travel: every maintainer
# clone gets it from the checkout rather than having to re-add it by hand. The
# inertness guard below stays regardless, so a maintainer checkout with no built
# binary is also a clean no-op.
#
# FAIL-OPEN on every uncertainty: no maintainer binary (adopter clone), no jq,
# no git, an unresolvable base ref, a non-JSON report, or any exit >= 2 from the
# checker. The gate exists to save a round trip, never to block a maintainer out
# of their own PR; CI is the authority that actually fails the build.

# -e is intentionally omitted: we must not abort before writing the deny JSON.
# All error-prone commands are individually guarded (|| true, 2>/dev/null).

# Whether this call carries a real `gh pr create` is the shared arming
# decision's to make (.claude/hooks/lib/verb-arming.sh), asked with this hook's
# own verb fragment: the library composes that fragment, byte for byte, into the
# anchored pattern pair it matches with, so the fragment below is where this
# file's own spelling of the verb lives. It arms on the verb in command
# position, at the very start or immediately after a shell separator, so
# mid-line mentions (`git commit -m "gh pr create"`,
# `echo "run gh pr create later"`) do not trip the gate. It also arms on a first
# command the shell would run as `gh pr create` however its characters are
# quoted, which a pattern over the raw text never sees.
#
# Newline is one of those separators, so a heredoc line beginning with the verb
# reads to the patterns like a real invocation. Dropping newline is not the
# answer: it would also stop matching the common multi-line shape
# (`git add -A\ngh pr create --fill`), which is a real invocation the gate must
# see. The shared decision settles it by proof instead, re-running the match
# against a view in which every heredoc body it can prove is DATA is masked out.
# What still arms is a body whose opener that proof cannot read as data, an
# interpreter feed (`bash <<EOF`) among them, which is the safe direction on a
# gate that is fail-open with CI authoritative.
#
# The fragment also captures the matched invocation's own argument text into
# `cmd_tail`. Deriving it from the same regex that decided the match keeps one
# parser governing both: a separate glob strip (`${cmd#*gh pr create}`) matches
# only single ASCII spaces, so `gh<TAB>pr<TAB>create` would find nothing,
# silently return the whole command, and reopen the cross-command capture the
# tail exists to prevent.
#
# The tail stops at the next separator rather than running to end of string, so
# a command CHAINED AFTER this one cannot donate a flag either. Unbounded,
# `gh pr create --fill && grep -B2 foo file` reads `2` as the base ref.
#
# The bound is textual, so a separator inside a quoted argument truncates the
# tail early (`--body "a && b" --base x` loses the `--base`). That direction is
# the safe one: a short tail falls back to the default branch, which is the
# right base for almost every PR, while a long tail adopts a ref from an
# unrelated command. Both are approximations of shell parsing; this one errs
# toward the answer that is usually correct.
#
# A quoted separator cuts the other way too, and that direction is NOT safe. It
# can rebind the MATCH, not just truncate the tail: in
# `echo "x; gh pr create --base develop" && gh pr create --fill` the `;` inside
# the quoted string is the leftmost separator, so the separator arm binds to the
# quoted mention rather than the real invocation, and that mention's `--base`
# narrows the changed set. Accepted, and the data proof does not close it: a
# quoted span is never suppressed there, because a `bash -c` runs what it is
# handed from inside one and a runner reached through a variable defeats any
# list of interpreter names. The gate is fail-open with CI authoritative, and
# both accepted trades are pinned by tests below so neither can drift silently
# into looking like a bug.
#
# Newline gets handled twice below, because it is the one separator that is also
# whitespace, and each half of that is a different hazard.
#
#   Joining first: the shell removes a backslash-newline pair before parsing, so
#   remove it here too. Without this the bound truncates the standard multi-line
#   form (`gh pr create \` + newline + `--base develop`) at the backslash and
#   loses every flag on the continued lines. That is one of the commonest ways
#   this command is written, not an edge case.
#
#   Nulling after: `[[:space:]]` includes newline, so the boundary group can
#   consume the newline that ENDS this invocation, letting the next line's text
#   land in the tail and donate its flags. A newline boundary means the
#   invocation carried no arguments at all, so the tail is empty by definition.
#   Excluding newline from the boundary group instead would be wrong: a bare
#   `gh pr create` on its own line in a script would then fail to match at all,
#   silently skipping the gate rather than tightening it.
cmd_joined="${cmd//\\$'\n'/}"

# The boundary group accepts a separator directly abutting the command as well
# as whitespace or end-of-string. Without that, `gh pr create;`,
# `gh pr create&&echo hi`, and `gh pr create|cat` match neither pattern and skip
# the gate entirely, since the character after `create` is a separator and so
# neither `[[:space:]]` nor `$`. The leading side already worked, because
# `[[:space:]]*` before `gh` is zero-or-more.
#
# The trailing `(.*)$` group carries no arming weight of its own: it matches the

Every file that would newly reach adopters needs an explicit ship-or-withhold decision before it lands. Pushing without one turns the 'Distribution Audit' CI job red after the fact; this catches it now, locally, with no network round trip.

To unblock:
  1. Run /distribution-audit and answer ship-or-withhold for each file above.
  2. Commit the regenerated .gaia/manifest.json (and .gaia/release-exclude for
     any withheld file) to this branch.
  3. Retry gh pr create.

Landing the manifest answer first also keeps HEAD stable through the later audit-marker handshake (see wiki/concepts/PR Merge Workflow.md, step 1).

This gate deliberately duplicates the unanswered-file rule from .github/workflows/distribution-audit-pr.yml; see this hook's header for why that rule is enforced in both places. It does not cover that workflow's second condition, region-declaration drift, which stays CI-only."
