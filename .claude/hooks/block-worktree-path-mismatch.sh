# PreToolUse Edit/Write/MultiEdit hook: deny a file_path that resolves to a
# checkout other than the linked git worktree this session works inside -- the
# main checkout or a sibling worktree.
#
# Once a session has switched into a linked worktree (see
# .claude/skills/gaia/references/isolation.md, "Export: RESOLVED_MODE and
# RESOLVED_ROOT"), every Edit/Write/MultiEdit call is expected to target that
# worktree. A stale absolute path from before the switch (e.g. the main
# checkout's own copy of a file that also exists in the worktree) is a
# different, equally valid file on disk, so the edit tools apply it with no
# error: the write silently lands in the wrong checkout. This is the
# silent-wrong-write footgun of tech-debt gaia-react/gaia#841.
#
# Tree identity comes from one shared rule and one shared resolver, so this
# guard never re-derives "which tree am I in":
#
#   Whose working directory: the payload's `cwd` field names the working
#   directory Claude Code reports for the agent that issued this call, and it is
#   authoritative for tree identity whenever it is absolute and resolves to a
#   checkout. It is honored on its own terms there: no comparison against the
#   hook's own process cwd. The absolute requirement is load-bearing, because
#   the value reaches a bare `cd` that would option-parse a leading dash and
#   succeed into the wrong directory. A payload cwd that is relative, or absolute
#   but not a checkout, is unusable and routes to the process cwd instead. The
#   process cwd is the fallback, and it alone would leave the guard inert
#   whenever the hook process sits outside the repository (tech-debt gaia-react/gaia#940), which
#   is an ALLOW; reading the payload first is what keeps the guard live.
#
#   Which tree, and where main is: .gaia/scripts/main-root-lib.sh is the one
#   resolver for both questions. gaia_is_linked_worktree answers whether the
#   acting cwd sits in a linked worktree at all, and gaia_resolve_main_root
#   answers the main checkout's root -- both symlink-canonicalized, env-stripped,
#   and correct in every checkout shape including submodules. Resolving both
#   roots physically keeps their comparison symmetric, so a checkout reached
#   through a symlinked path is never mistaken for a different tree.
#
# Scope: the guard adjudicates "does this target resolve into the acting tree",
# denying any write whose target lands in a different checkout -- the main
# checkout (gaia-react/gaia#841's own case) or a sibling linked worktree. The acting tree is the
# worktree the payload cwd names; the target's own tree is compared against it,
# so the question is answered from that one authoritative identity, not from main
# alone. This is the defense-in-depth role isolation.md contracts: deny an
# Edit/Write/MultiEdit whose file_path resolves to a different worktree than
# RESOLVED_ROOT.
#
# Fail-open, matching the other block-*.sh guards: any ambiguity (identity
# undeterminable, a target directory that does not exist yet, `git` unavailable,
# the resolver or registry unreachable) allows the call rather than blocking a
# legitimate edit on an identity it could not confirm. Blocking a legitimate
# edit is the cheap-to-notice failure, and this guard is defense-in-depth, not
# the only line.

# can no longer adjudicate, so it fails open.
#
# Both loads parse-check rather than carrying a trailing `|| exit 0`. Under
# `set -e` a failed `.` abandons the shell ahead of that arm, and the two ways
# it fails do not cost the same. Bash cannot open the file: the shell exits 1,
# which a PreToolUse hook reports as an advisory, so the edit proceeds
# unadjudicated with a raw diagnostic on stderr. That is the 3.2.57 stock macOS
# ships as /bin/bash; 5.x reaches the arm instead. Bash opens the file but
# cannot parse it, a lib left holding conflict markers: the shell exits 2, the
# deny code, so this fail-open guard denies the edit instead of allowing it.
#
# Both halves are 3.2-only, and it is the arm that makes them so: bash 5 lets
# the failed source's status reach `|| exit 0` for an unparseable lib exactly
# as it does for a missing one, measured both ways on 3.2.57 and 5.3.15. What
# separates the two halves is the exit code, 1 advisory against 2 deny, not
# their platform reach; only a bare `.` carrying no arm at all dies on both
# shells. The bats cases below are pinned to /bin/bash for that reason, and
# dropping the pin would green them against the spelling this replaced.
# `bash -n` answers both questions in one call and subsumes an existence test. Both loads sit past the tool-name and
# file-path gates above, so the forks are paid only on a real Edit/Write.
#
# What degrades in the arm's place is the `type` check below.
#
# Only the resolver loads here. The registry reader is deferred to its one
# point of use, far below, because the two sit behind very different gates and
# a parse check is a fork. This hook fires on every Edit/Write/MultiEdit, so a
# fork on this path is paid on every file the session touches, and it measures
# ~2.8ms on bash 3.2.57 and ~5.5ms on 5.3.15 against a ~16-22ms hook process on
# this machine, a surcharge rather than a doubling. The resolver has to
# be paid here: the linked-worktree predicate that gates everything below comes
# out of it, so there is no cheaper question to ask first that does not
# hand-roll a second copy of the resolution this file keeps in one place. The
# registry reader has no such constraint, and moving it behind the
# `.gaia/local` arm halves what an ordinary edit pays.
#
# Paying it at all was once argued against on the grounds that an unparseable
# library is rare and recoverable, because a denying Bash hook still leaves the
# editor tools free to repair it. That argument inverts here: the tool this
# hook denies IS the editor tool, so a corrupted library would deny the very
# Edit that repairs it. It no longer has to carry the decision alone, either.
# The pre-gate loads in the sibling hooks parse-check too, once the cost figure
# that argued for a cheaper arm failed to reproduce, so this is the norm across
# the family rather than an exception to it.

# gaia_registry_recognizes (with its own ancestor recognition: a container

# all; gaia_registry_classify then says which scope. Every scope except
# per-tree is main's by construction post-flip and is exempt outright:
# shared and main-anchored state already had no worktree-side copy worth
# protecting, and the ephemeral cache entries (spec-session locks,
# audit-window breadcrumbs, and the rest) never had one either -- denying
# them would block the sole correct write, not catch a wrong one (tech-debt
# gaia-react/gaia#934's class). A relpath the registry does not recognize at all (typo,
# stray, or genuinely unclassified) is NOT exempted here and falls through
# to the ordinary cross-tree deny below, the same as before the cutover.
#
# The one entry that still needs protecting is per-tree state
# (red-ledger/, worthiness-ledger/, forensics/, handoff/): each addresses
# itself under a subdirectory named by gaia_tree_key
# (.gaia/scripts/main-root-lib.sh), the acting tree's own physically-resolved
# root, hashed. A write whose path carries the ACTING tree's own key is
# exempt; one carrying a peer tree's key, or the bare unkeyed container, is
# not, and falls through to the same deny.
#
# LOST PROTECTION: pre-cutover this guard told a correct per-tree write from
# a stale pre-switch one by PHYSICAL location -- a real per-worktree
# directory versus main's. Post-cutover the tree key in the path is the only
# signal, and a key is a deterministic hash of a tree's own root, not a
# secret: this guard can no longer distinguish a write that is genuinely
# from a live session in the acting tree from an absolute path some other
# mechanism constructed that merely happens to embed the acting tree's own
# key. Designing a replacement is a later phase's job; naming the loss here
# is this one's.
