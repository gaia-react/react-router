# PreToolUse Edit/Write/MultiEdit + Bash hook: deny a Code Audit Team
# member's attempt to repair a path outside its self-heal boundary.
#
# This is the LOCAL producer's enforcement point. The CI producer's
# equivalent is the "Commit and push self-heal" step's push gate in
# .github/workflows/code-review-audit.yml, which reads the whole self-heal
# diff at push time. Phase 1 of this SPEC makes `local` the default
# resolved mode, and the CI push gate binds only forks and the override
# label, so a local-mode member had no deterministic boundary at all until
# this hook. Both enforcement points source the SAME refusal set from
# .claude/hooks/lib/audit-selfheal-paths.sh; neither carries a second copy.
#
# THE GATE BINDS MEMBERS, NOT THE TREE. A PreToolUse payload carries
# `agent_type` only when the hook fires inside a subagent call; it is
# absent for the main session / orchestrator. This hook no-ops immediately
# whenever `agent_type` is absent or does not carry the `code-audit-`
# prefix, so the orchestrator (trusted by the SPEC's own design, and which
# this very plan's execution requires to repair .gaia/**, test/**, and
# .github/workflows/** on nearly every phase) is never touched. Only a
# dispatched Code Audit Team member (`code-audit-frontend`,
# `code-audit-github-workflows`, etc.) is bound, including advisory members:
# an advisory member returns a byte-identical tree anyway, so refusing it
# costs nothing, and a future self-healing member is bound the day it lands
# rather than the day someone remembers to add it.
#
# Membership is a NAME-PREFIX match, not a roster lookup: the hook fires on
# every edit in every session, so it stays off the classifier's parse path
# and carries no dependency on the roster's record contract. A member named
# off the `code-audit-` convention escapes this hook; that convention is
# already load-bearing in the roster glob, the machinery lists, and the
# release scrub's leak-check, so this adds no new coupling.
#
# HONEST ABOUT THE BASH VECTOR: this is a best-effort, defense-in-depth
# guard, not an airtight one, mirroring block-manifest-write.sh's own stated
# posture. Bash vectors are unbounded; this covers the well-known write
# shapes (output redirect, tee, sed -i with or without a macOS '' backup
# suffix, sponge, cp/mv as destination) and no more. CI's gate reads the
# whole diff at push time and cannot be evaded by the shape of the write;
# this hook reads one attempted edit at a time and can be. That asymmetry is
# real and accepted: under local mode a human watches every turn.
#
# The Bash branch also carries one EXECUTION-shape refusal, not a write
# shape: a dispatched member may not invoke
# .gaia/scripts/write-audit-remits.sh at all, since running it edits
# .claude/agents/code-audit-*.md and rotates every member's clearance
# digest. That literal lives here, not in the shared
# AUDIT_SELFHEAL_REFUSE_ERE, because that ERE is a path matcher the CI push
# gate applies to a diff, and a script invocation is not a path in a diff.

# jq is not optional here, and its absence must not fall through to the tool
# call. Under the errexit armed above, a missing jq ends the agent_type read
# below at status 127, and PreToolUse reads 127 as a non-blocking error: the
# refused edit proceeds with no denial and no diagnostic, a fail-open in a
# hook whose header commits to the opposite. `deny` cannot carry this
# refusal, since it builds its JSON response with jq, so this arm writes a
# plain-text reason and exits 2, the exit-code block contract, which needs no
# interpreter at all.
#
# It refuses NARROWLY. This gate binds `code-audit-*` members only, and with no
# jq the payload's agent_type cannot be read, so an unconditional refusal here
# would deny every Edit/Write/MultiEdit and every Bash call in every session,
# the install command that repairs the machine among them: a session with no
# way out from inside it. The raw payload is tested instead for the literal
# `code-audit-`, which a bound member's agent_type must contain. Its ABSENCE
# proves the payload carries no such agent_type and the call sits outside this
# gate's remit, so it is allowed exactly as a parsed non-member is. Its
# presence is not proof of membership -- an ordinary Bash command naming a
# member satisfies it too -- and that over-deny is the same safe direction the
# tokenizer below takes everywhere else.

    # a `VAR=VALUE` assignment, so `sh -x <writer>`, `bash --norc <writer>`,
    # `env FOO=1 <writer>`, and `nohup <writer>` all deny. `-c` is never
    # treated as a skippable option: its argument is a quoted script STRING
    # this whitespace tokenizer cannot safely parse, so `bash -c '<writer>'`
    # is a stated, out-of-scope gap. A backtick-quoted invocation is a second
    # stated gap, and deliberately not closed the way the brackets below are:
    # a backtick is common inside ordinary quoted prose (a commit message
    # naming a script), so padding it would false-deny commands that write
    # nothing. A read-only command that merely NAMES the file as an argument
    # (`shellcheck .gaia/scripts/write-audit-remits.sh`, `cat ...`,
    # `git log --grep ...`) is not an invocation of it and must stay allowed.
    #
    # A separator only ends a token when whitespace happens to follow it, so
    # `<check>; <writer>`, `true&&bash <writer>`, and `echo x| bash <writer>`
    # would otherwise present the separator glued to a neighbour and never
    # mark a boundary at all. That is the realistic bypass, not an
    # adversarial one: the check prints `repair:  bash .gaia/scripts/write-
    # audit-remits.sh` under every finding, so chaining the printed repair
    # onto the check that printed it is the natural next keystroke. Pad every
    # separator character into a standalone token for THIS scan only, in its
    # own array: the write-shape loop below reads the unpadded `toks`, where
    # `>` / `>>` and exact `;`/`&&` shapes are load-bearing. `&&` and `||`
    # degrade to two adjacent single-character tokens, which is harmless
    # because this scan only asks whether a boundary occurred, never which
    # operator produced it. Padding can also split a quoted argument, which
    # only ever widens the deny surface, the safe direction here.
    #
    # A subshell opener needs the same padding for a second reason: unpadded it
    # GLUES to the command it opens, so `(bash <writer>` tokenizes as `(bash`,
    # which is not the interpreter `bash`. Padded, `(` becomes a standalone
    # token that marks a boundary and the command it opens reads at an
    # execution position; `)` is padded so a closer glued to the writer
    # (`<writer>)`) cannot defeat the `${cand##*/}` basename match. Padding `(`
    # deliberately makes `(cd foo && ...)` an execution position as well, and
    # turns both an array literal (`files=(<writer>)`) and paren-led quoted
    # prose (`echo "(<writer>)"`, the likeliest of the three to be hit in
    # practice) into a false deny: over-denying is the safe direction for this
    # guard.
    #
    # PADDING SHREDS, so the scan never trusts a single tokenization. Any
    # character padded into a standalone token also splits every construct
    # that embeds it mid-word: `(` shreds `$(pwd)/<writer>` into `"$` `(`
    # `pwd` `)` `/<writer>`, stranding the basename away from an execution
    # position. Padding `{` would do the identical thing to `${ROOT}/<writer>`,
    # the path form .claude/rules/repo-relative-paths.md teaches, which is why
    # braces are NOT padded (and do not need to be: `{bash foo; }` is a syntax
    # error, so a real brace group already presents `{` as its own word, and
    # `}` is already detached by the `;` padding).
    #
    # Rather than hand-audit each padded character for that hazard, scan BOTH
    # tokenizations and take the union. The scan only ever denies, so a second
    # pass is structurally incapable of losing a deny: whatever a padded
    # stream shreds, the unpadded stream still carries whole. That makes the
    # guard immune to this class for any character padded here in future,
    # rather than fixing one bracket at a time.
