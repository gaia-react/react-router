# PreToolUse + SessionStart hook: deny the FOURTH Code Audit Team dispatch
# wave in one session, on one branch. The semantics live in
# wiki/concepts/PR Merge Workflow.md, "#### The three-round session cap";
# this hook enforces them, it does not restate them.
#
# WHY A HOOK AND NOT PROSE. The pre-merge audit's fix-and-re-audit loop has
# no stop of its own: every round's fixes buy the next dispatch, so an
# unattended run spends without bound while the session's own context fills
# with reports it can no longer weigh against each other. The judgement
# "is a fourth round worth it" gets made mid-loop by the session least able
# to make it. Prose cannot hold a boundary an agent has a standing reason to
# cross, the same lesson block-spec-plan-chain.sh was written for; this hook
# is that file's structural twin, same session-keyed main-anchored
# sentinel, same deny mechanism, same fail-open posture.
#
# WAVE IDENTITY: the acting tree's HEAD tree SHA. A round is one dispatch
# wave, whatever that wave spawns. Every member in a wave is dispatched
# against one HEAD, so every hook invocation in that wave computes the same
# tree and only the first one records it -- this collapses N parallel
# dispatches by construction, no timing window to misfire. It is sound
# rather than a coincidence: the workflow requires HEAD to move between
# rounds ("HEAD must move so the next audit runs against the fixed tree"),
# so a genuine new round always presents a new tree. The one hardened
# re-dispatch of a member that no-op'd (see
# wiki/concepts/PR Merge Workflow.md, "#### No-op detection and retry for
# each dispatched member", and .claude/rules/subagent-dispatch.md) shares
# its wave's unmoved tree and is therefore free, which is correct: it is
# not a new round, it is the first one finishing.
#
# STATED FAILURE MODES, honestly:
# - A deliberate re-dispatch against an unmoved tree (no intervening commit)
#   is under-counted. This is the same shape as the no-op retry and the
#   guard cannot tell the two apart without a heuristic; under-counting is
#   the safe direction for a bound that ends a session rather than
#   protecting correctness.
# - A commit that leaves the tree byte-identical (an empty commit, a
#   message-only amend) reads as the same wave, same direction, same
#   acceptance.
# - A dispatch cancelled at the permission prompt has already counted: the
#   count is taken at PreToolUse. Recovery is local: remove the gitignored
#   counter file under .gaia/local/cache/.
#
# WHY DENY AND NOT ASK. An "ask" verdict puts the "is this branch worth a
# fourth round" question back to the session mid-loop, exactly the
# judgement the cap refuses to leave there.
#
# WHY NO OVERRIDE KNOB. A knob spelled once becomes the default path, and a
# cap with a documented bypass is prose again. The sanctioned escape is the
# workflow's own: push round three, emit the continuation prompt, let a
# human start a fresh session with its own three.
#
# FAIL-OPEN POSTURE, AND ITS COST. Every unknown (unresolvable payload
# field, absent session id, unresolvable git state, unreadable counter)
# exits 0 silently, so a harness that never delivers this event, or a
# roster member named off the code-audit- convention, leaves the guard
# inert rather than misfiring. "Inert" and "working" are indistinguishable
# from this file alone, and the bats suite cannot close that: it invokes this
# script directly and never exercises the .claude/settings.json registration,
# so a matcher edit, a rename, or a dropped registration leaves every test
# green. Nothing in the tree re-proves the enforcement point, and this header
# claims no such guard. What proves it is a live drive: seed the counter with
# three dummy trees, attempt one real member dispatch, assert the deny. That
# is a step the pre-merge gate's own verify-your-own-work obligation
# (.claude/rules/pr-merge.md) puts on whoever changes the registration, not a
# fixture standing watch here.
#
# SCOPE: only tool_input.subagent_type matching code-audit-* counts. The
# roster does not pin the literal subagent_type a member's own internal
# fan-out (its specialists and refuters) carries --
# .claude/agents/code-audit-frontend.md says only "an explicit
# subagent_type (a general reviewer)" and never names general-purpose, so
# this header does not claim that literal either. The filter does not need
# that pin: a nested dispatch shares its dispatching wave's HEAD tree, so it
# is free under the wave-identity rule whatever it is named. The
# code-audit- prefix match is a second, cheaper line of defence whose real
# job is keeping this hook off the git path for the overwhelming majority
# of dispatches, which are not members at all -- put before any git or
# filesystem work for that reason.
#
# ANTI-EVASION. session_id is shared between a parent session and every
# subagent it dispatches (both report the same identifier, per
# wiki/concepts/Claude Hooks.md), so a member dispatched from inside another
# subagent still carries this session's id and still counts. Only
# .tool_input.subagent_type is read to identify the dispatched agent; there
# is no tool_input.agent_type. The agent_type field block-selfheal-paths.sh
# reads is a TOP-LEVEL payload field naming the agent MAKING the call, the
# opposite question, and folding it in here would count a member's own
# nested dispatches as if they were top-level rounds.
#
# /clear AND COMPACTION. /clear is the sanctioned reset (SessionStart,
# source == "clear"): it cannot be typed by the model or any subagent, so
# it is human-gated by construction, and it empties the very context the
# cap exists to bound. Compaction deliberately does NOT reset: by the
# fourth round the session holds three reports in a context it is about to
# compact, which is the condition the cap exists for, and a counter that
# reset on compaction would be inert exactly when it matters.

BLOCKED: three Code Audit Team rounds are already spent in this session on branch ${branch}. The fourth dispatch wave is what the cap forbids.

This is not a defect and not a merge blocker. The cap bounds this session's context and cost, not the change: \`gh pr merge\` is still governed only by the clearance markers the merge gate already requires, and a clean round, or one carrying only accepted residuals, merges at any round number.

Do this, in order:
1. If round three's findings are not yet fixed, committed, and pushed, do that now exactly as any other round's.
2. Emit the continuation prompt described in \`wiki/concepts/PR Merge Workflow.md\`, \`#### The three-round session cap\`, fenced so it pastes as one unit. It carries the PR number, the branch and its base, that three rounds are spent, the re-run carry-forward ledger at ${ledger_dir}/<AUDIT_KEY>.rerun.json and that the fixer reads its \`remaining[]\` and \`fixed_last_round[]\`, what each round fixed, which findings are accepted residuals already recorded in the PR body, and an instruction to re-read that page and resume at step 1.
3. End the run. Do not continue the rounds in a subagent, a fork, or a session you start yourself: that spends the same budget against the same branch and defeats the bound.

A human resumes by typing /clear and pasting that prompt; /clear releases this guard so the next session starts with its own three. There is no override flag.
