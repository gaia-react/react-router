#!/usr/bin/env bash
# audit-dispositions.sh: the shared disposition-ledger logic for the Code Audit
# Team. Sourced, never executed; does no work at source time.
#
# The disposition-ledger sidecar is keyed to the frontend member's content
# digest (<frontend-digest>.dispositions.json), valid iff the frontend earned
# marker for that digest is valid. Four functions:
#
#   disposition_offenders <sidecar> [<acting-root>]
#       Prints one offender line per unmet disposition on stdout; empty output
#       (and exit 0) means clean. FAIL-OPEN everywhere it cannot prove an
#       inconsistency: no sidecar, unparseable sidecar, backend "absent", or any
#       gh/tooling failure. Blocks ONLY on a confirmed present-backend
#       filed-but-missing key, a pending(definitive) entry, or a
#       `machinery_waived` entry whose key path is NEITHER a gate-machinery path
#       NOR a file the pull request under judgment already changes (the
#       abuse-check that keeps the machinery-waive disposition from becoming a
#       universal escape hatch). <acting-root> is the git tree whose whole-PR
#       diff supplies that changed-file set; omitted or empty, the changed-files
#       term contributes nothing and the gate-machinery term decides the arm
#       alone. Called by both the deterministic backstop hook
#       (.claude/hooks/audit-disposition-check.sh) and the merge gate
#       (.claude/hooks/pr-merge-audit-check.sh) to re-verify the current
#       sidecar's claims.
#
#   disposition_notes <sidecar> [<acting-root>]
#       Prints one operator-visible note line per `machinery_waived` entry whose
#       verdict is reached WITHOUT the changed-files term, so a gate can tell
#       "could not verify" from "verified clean". Takes the same arguments as
#       disposition_offenders and resolves the changed-file set through the same
#       helper, so there is one eligibility implementation rather than two. It
#       denies nothing itself; the gates decide what to do with the lines.
#
#   disposition_note_block <notes>
#       Renders disposition_notes' output as the block a gate writes to stderr
#       and appends to its deny reason. Both gates fire on the same
#       `gh pr merge` and describe the same conditions, so they render it from
#       here rather than each carrying a copy that can drift.
#
#   disposition_seed_forward <prev-sidecar> <new-sidecar>
#       Unions every still-open entry (`filed`, or `pending` with
#       `pending_reason` "definitive") from <prev-sidecar> into <new-sidecar>,
#       in place. A fresh incremental audit does not re-encounter a prior
#       out-of-scope finding, so a digest rotation alone would silently drop a
#       still-open receipt; the code-audit-frontend agent calls this when it
#       writes the sidecar for a new frontend digest, seeding it from the
#       immediately-prior frontend digest's sidecar so the receipt survives the
#       rotation. HEAD's fresh entry always wins on a key collision (a seeded
#       entry may only ADD keys). A plain still-open union: no anchor
#       selection, no ancestry, no backend precedence.
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible (macOS default). Never `cd`.

# --- eligibility helpers (private) -------------------------------------------
#
# The `machinery_waived` abuse-check asks two questions about the tree under
# judgment: which files the pull request changes, and whether the sidecar it is
# reading belongs to that pull request at all. Both answers are resolved once
# per call and shared by disposition_offenders and disposition_notes, so there
# is ONE eligibility implementation rather than two.

# _disposition_changed_set <acting-root> <outfile>
#
# Writes the whole-PR changed-file set for <acting-root> to <outfile>:
# NUL-delimited, repo-relative POSIX paths, UNFILTERED by file type. The waive
# rule is about any file the pull request touches, so a review-scope pathspec
# has no place here.
#
# The ladder itself now lives in .claude/hooks/lib/audit-base-provenance.sh:
# this function's copy became that shared definition rather than staying a
# private one. What survives here is the two-source read of which branch
# (below), passed to the shared resolver as an explicit argument, and the
# final NUL-delimited diff against the resolved base.
#
# THE BASE BRANCH IS THE PULL REQUEST'S OWN, NOT THE REPOSITORY'S DEFAULT, and
# that is the answer to a question the two consumers of a whole-PR base do not
# share. Membership (.gaia/scripts/resolve-audit-members.sh) is safe wide: a
# wider diff dispatches more members than the pull request owes, and over-
# dispatching is the fail-closed direction. Eligibility is not. It decides
# which out-of-scope findings the machinery waive may cover, so every extra
# file in the set is one more finding that can be waived into the pull-request
# body instead of filed as durable tech debt, and a wrongly waived finding
# reads exactly like a correctly waived one. A pull request stacked on any
# branch other than the default is where the two answers part: the default
# branch's fork point is BELOW the base branch's own commits, so the set comes
# to include files the base branch changed and this pull request never touched.
#
# Two sources answer "which branch", in order:
#
#   1. GITHUB_BASE_REF under Actions, which the pull_request event sets, so the
#      value comes from the event rather than from whoever invoked this. It is
#      process environment and is NOT scoped to <acting-root>; under Actions it
#      describes the checkout the job is building, which is the same tree.
#      Read HERE, at this call site, and passed to the shared resolver as an
#      explicit argument: the resolver itself reads no environment variable
#      naming a base branch, because the merge gate refuses an
#      environment-sourced base by name, and lifting this arm into the shared
#      resolver as written would import that refusal's hole into the gate.
#      That is a deliberate boundary, not an oversight.
#   2. the pull request's own record (`gh pr view`), which is what the merge
#      gate's bypasses read (.claude/hooks/pr-merge-audit-check.sh). `gh` takes
#      its repository from the working directory and has no -C, so the subshell
#      is what scopes this one to <acting-root>.
#
# Either answer counts only when its remote-tracking ref resolves, and the
# verified ref is then the ONLY thing allowed to scope the diff: a bare local
# branch of the same name is not evidence about the base branch, and one
# sitting on this pull request's own commits would put the merge base above
# them and empty the set. Unverifiable, absent, or unreadable means fall
# through to the advertised default, which is the pre-existing behavior.
#
# That fallback is the WIDE one, so it is the loose direction for this
# consumer, and it is chosen anyway: the alternative on a failed lookup is to
# narrow toward a set nothing supports, which turns every ordinary offline run
# into a wave of false denials.
#
# Both sides, the default member's fence (write) and this function (verify),
# read those two sources in that order, so a run where both resolve the same
# answer agrees on every ordinary checkout. They do NOT run at the same
# moment, and the residual gap below is a property of that, not of the
# sources.
#
# The two sides can also disagree on the SAME head, and this is a second,
# separate gap: the write side (the default member's own out-of-scope base
# fence) still spells its remote-minting ref as the bare `origin/<name>`,
# while the verify side (this function, through the shared resolver) now
# takes the fully-qualified `refs/remotes/origin/<name>`. A checkout carrying
# a local branch literally named `origin/<default>` therefore makes the two
# sides resolve DIFFERENT bases here, a known, bounded residue rather than an
# unconditional "by construction" agreement.
#
#   - verify wide, write narrow -> safe. The agent files what it could not
#     waive, and a wider verify side never denies a filed finding.
#   - verify narrow, write wide -> a false DENY, `machinery-waived-not-eligible`
#     on a waive that was honest when it was written. Its reachable shape is an
#     audit run before `gh pr create`, where neither source answers for the
#     write side while the merge gate later resolves the record. It is
#     fail-closed and a re-audit on the now-existing pull request clears it, at
#     the cost of one round.
#
# Closing that gap by recording the write side's resolved base in the sidecar
# and reading it back here is deliberately NOT done. The sidecar is the
# artifact under judgment, so a base taken from it lets the side being checked
# choose the scope it is checked against, which is the one thing this
# abuse-check exists to refuse: it re-derives the eligibility set independently
# rather than trusting anything the sidecar records.
#
# Returns 0 when the base RESOLVED: the file's contents are the answer, and an
# empty file is a real, empty answer. Returns 1 when the base did NOT resolve,
# <acting-root> is empty, or <acting-root> is not a git tree -- an UNKNOWN,
# never an empty answer.
#
# The base is tested for emptiness BEFORE the diff runs, and the emptiness of
# the diff is never the discriminator: git resolves an empty left side to HEAD,
# so an unresolved base and a resolved base with no differences produce
# identical empty output while demanding opposite verdicts.
#
# `-z` disables git's path quoting, so a non-ASCII path arrives as raw UTF-8
# bytes that compare byte for byte against the key's `path=`. Accepted
# limitation, named once: a path containing a literal newline is indistinguishable
# from two paths once read, so it fails to match and the finding is filed, which
# is the safe direction.

# judging several consecutive pull requests; a changed-files verdict on another
# pull request's entry would be a false deny.
#
# The branch term runs first and is the only DECISIVE one:
#
#   0. `branch` recorded, the acting root resolves a branch of its own, and the
#      two differ                                      -> NOT attributable
#
# Everything else falls through to the sha chain:
#
#   1. `sha` absent, empty, or not 40 hex digits       -> attributable
#   2. `merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> HEAD` exits 0   -> attributable
#   3. it exits 1 (a REAL non-ancestor)                -> the orphan probe,
#      `for-each-ref --contains <sha> --count=1 refs/heads refs/remotes`:
#        non-empty (the commit lives on another live ref) -> NOT attributable
#        empty (orphaned)                                 -> attributable
#   4. any other status (128 on an unknown object, git unavailable, no acting
#      root), or a probe that errors                   -> attributable
#
# The exit statuses are discriminated explicitly because only 1 means "resolved,
# and not an ancestor". Reading mere non-zero collapses an unknown object into a
# real non-ancestor and sets aside entries that cannot be judged either way.
#
# The orphan probe separates another pull request's commit, reachable from that
# branch's ref, from this branch's own rewritten-away commit, reachable from
# none. Without it an amend, rebase, or force-push sets every entry aside, and a
# waive on a path that is neither machinery nor changed silently stops denying.
#
# WHY THE BRANCH TERM EXISTS: reachability cannot tell those two cases apart
# once the other pull request is squash-merged with `--delete-branch`. The
# squash writes a NEW commit and the branch is gone, so the merged head is
# reachable from no ref and takes the orphan arm while belonging to the
# other-pull-request arm, and the previous pull request's entries are judged
# against an unrelated diff. The recorded branch answers directly what
# reachability can only approximate. It is offline and deterministic, which a
# `gh` lookup of the sha's pull request would not be, and it holds in CI, which
# a reflog probe would not.
#
# Its honest limit: a sidecar written before the field existed records no
# branch, so it falls through to the sha chain and behaves exactly as it does
# without this term. That is the fail-toward-unchanged direction, and it is
# self-clearing, the sidecar is gitignored local state that a digest rotation
# replaces.
#
# A branch MATCH decides nothing and falls through on purpose. Only a mismatch
# is positive evidence of another branch; a match leaves the sha chain's own
# arms, an ancestor sha is attributability proof the branch name cannot supply,
# in place rather than short-circuiting past them.
#
# Attributable is the fail-toward-unchanged-behavior direction throughout: the
# check never sets an entry aside on a guess.

# --- disposition_offenders <sidecar> [<acting-root>] -------------------------
#
# The sidecar `key` is the dedup-key INNER content `v1 class=… path=… line=…`
# WITHOUT the `<!-- gaia-debt-key: … -->` wrapper; a filed issue body carries
# the wrapped form. A match reconstructs the WRAPPED form and tests the issue
# body for it as a SUBSTRING (the trailing ` -->` prevents a `line=4` key
# digit-prefix-matching a sibling `line=42 -->` issue), never whole-line
# equality. A CLOSED matching issue is a SATISFIED disposition, not an offender.
#
# The `machinery_waived` disposition is a sanctioned NON-file outcome for a
# non-security out-of-scope finding: the finding is recorded in the pull-request
# body instead of opening a durable tech-debt issue. It is legitimate ONLY when
# the key's `path=` falls in the UNION of two sets -- the gate-machinery paths
# (`audit_path_is_machinery`) and the files the pull request under judgment
# already changes (<acting-root>'s whole-PR diff). Anywhere else the entry is an
# unfiled out-of-scope finding wearing a machinery label, so it is an offender.
# This is the deterministic abuse-check shared by the backstop hook and the
# merge gate.
#
# The arm reads no issue backend, and its verdict rests on local git calls: one
# for the changed-file set, one to attribute the sidecar to the tree under
# judgment. The changed-file set does read the pull request's own record to
# learn which branch it merges into, and only when Actions has not already
# supplied that; every failure there falls back to a purely local answer, so
# the arm still reaches a verdict with no network at all.
#
# Three states are distinguished from "verified clean", each carried by a
# `disposition_notes` line rather than left silent:
#
#   - the machinery classifier cannot be resolved -> the WHOLE arm produces no
#     offenders and neither term runs. Running the changed-files term alone
#     would make the arm stricter than the machinery term alone is, turning a
#     machinery-path waive into an offender whenever the classifier is missing;
#   - the sidecar is not attributable to the tree under judgment (it was written
#     while judging a different pull request) -> the entry is set aside: no
#     offender line and no changed-files verdict;
#   - the sidecar is attributable but the diff base does not resolve -> the
#     changed-files term contributes nothing and the machinery term decides
#     alone, so a non-machinery entry is an offender.

# --- disposition_notes <sidecar> [<acting-root>] -----------------------------
#

# from "verified clean". Three line shapes, in this precedence:
#
#   machinery-classifier-unavailable: <key>
#       the machinery path list could not be loaded, so the waive abuse-check
#       did not run at all for this merge
#   changed-files-not-attributable: <key>
#       the sidecar was written while judging a different pull request, so its
#       entries are set aside rather than judged against this diff
#   changed-files-unverified: <key>
#       the sidecar is attributable, but this tree's pull-request diff base does
#       not resolve, so only the gate-machinery term is evaluated
#
# An attributable sidecar under a resolved base emits NO line, for a
# gate-machinery path as much as for a changed one: that verdict is "verified
# clean", the state these notes exist to be distinguishable from.
#
# All three conditions are properties of the CALL rather than of an individual
# entry, so every `machinery_waived` entry in the sidecar carries the same line.
# The preconditions mirror disposition_offenders exactly -- no jq, no sidecar,
# an unparseable sidecar, or backend "absent" -- because in each of those the
# waive arm does not run for a reason that is not about eligibility, and there
# is no line shape for it.
