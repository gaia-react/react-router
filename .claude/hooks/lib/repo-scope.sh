# Act-on-home variant, for a consumer that ACTS on the home repo rather than
# blocking on it: posts a comment, strips a label. Same question, opposite
# fail direction and a different comparison.
#
# Fail direction. The guard above resolves every ambiguity to 1 ("home"), so a
# blocking consumer keeps enforcing; over-enforcement is safe. Reading a foreign
# command as home is not safe for a consumer that acts: it writes to a pull
# request or an issue the command never named. So here every ambiguity resolves
# to 0 ("foreign") and the caller declines.
#
# The inversion reaches the whole question rather than one arm of it, because
# this entry point does not share the guard's arms. It reads the merge with the
# first-command scan below, so a redirection ahead of the merge is not a shape
# it has to model: any prefix at all means the first command is not the merge,
# and it declines. `pushd`, a subshell `(cd ...`, and a `cd` to a path that does
# not resolve are each foreign here for that one reason, and so is a `-R`
# belonging to a later command in the same tool call.
#
# Comparison. gh identifies a repository as [HOST/]OWNER/REPO, so this compares
# the WHOLE value against one `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,url` call,
# case-insensitively because GitHub resolves OWNER/REPO that way. The guard
# above compares the repo-NAME half against the checkout's directory basename,
# which reads a same-named fork (`--repo other-org/<homename>` from a checkout
# named `<homename>`, the ordinary fork topology) as home. That is the safe
# direction there and the wrong one here.
#
# Usage (from a hook that acts on the home repo, after extracting $cmd):
#   _lib="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/lib" 2>/dev/null && pwd)"

#   if cmd_targets_foreign_repo_slug "$cmd"; then exit 0; fi      # foreign: decline
#
# The `type` guard is not optional decoration. Sourcing this lib cwd-relative
# and then writing `type f >/dev/null 2>&1 && f "$cmd"` falls THROUGH to acting
# when the source misses, which is the fail-open composition of a missing
# boundary check and a consumer that acts. Source from ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} and

# First-command scan, shared by every consumer that acts on the home repo.
#
# Split the command into shell-like words. This is a real scan rather than a
# set of patterns over the raw text, and the difference is the whole point: a
# quote character opens a span in which whitespace, separators and the other
# quote character are all ordinary text, and a backslash escapes the
# character after it. Pattern-matching the raw text got this wrong once per
# spelling, always in the direction of reading part of one value, or part of
# a following command, as the pull-request reference or as the repository.
#
# The scan reads the FIRST command in the tool call and hands back its words.
# Whatever sits ahead of a command decides how that command should be read,
# and reading it needs the shell's own semantics: a comment hides a command,
# a heredoc body is not a quoted span so its lines read as commands, `cd` and
# `(cd` and `pushd` decide which repository the command lands in, and each of
# those is a construct rather than a spelling, so every rule naming one left
# the next one open. Requiring the command to come first closes the whole
# class at once: there is no prefix left to misread, and every word a caller
# sees comes from the invocation itself.
#
# The words that come out are unquoted, so nothing downstream needs to know
# quotes exist, and a `;` inside a squash subject stays text.
#
# Sets GAIA_FIRST_COMMAND_WORDS to the first command's words. Returns 0 when
# it read at least one word, 1 when the string held no command at all.
#
# Also sets GAIA_FIRST_COMMAND_CLOSED: 0 when no separator and no comment closed
# the first command, 1 when one did with something after it. A caller asking
# whether a second command was spelled with a separator cannot ask that of the
# text, because the spellings that matter break any literal scan of it
# (`gh pr "merge" <n>`, a line continuation inside the verb, a subshell, a brace
# group). This scan tokenizes the way the shell does, so it answers that
# question exactly, and publishing the answer costs one assignment rather than
# a second parser.
#
# What it does NOT report is EXPANSION. A command substitution, a backtick and
# a process substitution are ordinary word text to a scan that models words, so
# a string carrying one reaches the end with this flag still 0 while the shell
# runs the payload. A caller that needs "nothing else runs at all" has to rule
# that class out itself; this flag is one half of that question, not the whole

  # merging is ordinary, so the input is not small. Two things keep it cheap

  # whitespace, separators and newlines are all ordinary text, so a quoted
  # `--body` is one word however long the prose is. Appending per character
  # made the scan quadratic in that body's size: seconds of synchronous stall
  # on a deny-capable gate at a size an ordinary pull-request body reaches.
  # Flushing per block bounds the per-character append by BLOCK and pays the

# the value can tell from gh's own repository flag, since a path argument
# carries a slash exactly as a slug does. The scan tells them apart by knowing

# URL-reference form of the act-on-home question, shared by the same two
# consumers.
#
# gh takes `<number> | <url> | <branch>` as a merge selector, and a URL is the
# one form `-R`/`--repo` cannot qualify: gh resolves the repository from the
# URL itself and ignores the flag, so the scanned repository is empty and the
# comparison above reads it as home. A consumer that ACTS on the home
# repository therefore cannot take a URL's number at face value: a merged
# sibling-repository pull request read by URL would reach THIS repository's
# pull request or issue of the same number, because the write resolves here.
#
# Both consumers ask this of the identical scanned value, which is why the
# answer lives here beside the `-R`/`--repo` half rather than twice in them.
# The two halves are one boundary, and a boundary that answers the same
# question two different ways depending on which hook asks it is the failure
# a single definition rules out.

  # Two shapes are matched as loosely as gh matches them; everywhere else this
  # stays deliberately tighter, so the first half is not a rule to follow gh
  # everywhere. gh's own URL matcher is `^/([^/]+)/([^/]+)/pull/(\d+)` against
  # the parsed path, UNANCHORED at the end, and it compares `u.Hostname()`,
  # which drops both a port and any userinfo.
  #
  # Followed: a `/`, `?`, or `#` suffix, the Files tab's own address being
  # `.../pull/7/files`, and a `:port` on the authority. gh merges the home
  # pull request each of those names, so declining one costs the consumer a
  # merge it should have acted on, which is the whole reason to loosen.
  #
  # Not followed: a suffix has to start with a separator, so `/pull/7files`
  # declines where gh's unanchored regex reads pull request 7, and userinfo
  # stays on the compared authority, so `https://user@github.com/...` declines
  # too. Every divergence that remains declines, which is this function's safe
  # direction, so each costs a silent no-op rather than a wrong write.
  #
  # That last sentence is why the scheme is `https?` and not a general scheme
  # class. gh reads only http and https as a URL and treats any other scheme
  # as a branch name, so a general class accepts `ftp://<home>/pull/7` and
  # hands back 7 for a reference gh never resolved: an ACCEPT where gh
  # declines, which is the one direction a boundary that acts cannot have.
  # Narrowing here keeps every divergence on the declining side.
  #
  # The bracketed spelling is a case-insensitive `https?`. A URL scheme is
  # case-insensitive and Go lowercases it before gh ever sees it, so a plain
  # `https?` would decline `HTTPS://<home>/pull/7`, which gh merges. The
  # alternative, `shopt -s nocasematch`, is process-global: it would also
  # reach the port strip below and every later `[[ ]]` in whichever hook
  # sourced this file.
