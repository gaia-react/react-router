# Shared helper for the worthiness ledger, the ONE definition of where a
# tree's worthiness verdicts live. Both the ledger writer
# (.gaia/scripts/audit-ledger/append-worthiness.mjs) and its reader
# (.claude/hooks/worthiness-presence-check.sh) call this instead of hand-
# building the path literal independently, matching the problem
# .claude/hooks/lib/red-ledger.sh already solves for the RED ledger. Dual-
# mode: source it for the function below, or run it directly as a script so
# the Node writer can shell out to it (see "Usage (executable)" below).
#
# Usage (sourced, from a hook script, at any working directory):
#   _lib_dir="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/lib" 2>/dev/null && pwd)" || _lib_dir=''
#   [ -n "$_lib_dir" ] && [ -f "$_lib_dir/worthiness-ledger.sh" ] && . "$_lib_dir/worthiness-ledger.sh"
#   ledger=$(worthiness_ledger_path "$tree_root")
#
# Usage (executable):
#   bash .claude/hooks/lib/worthiness-ledger.sh [dir]
#
# No persistent `cd`; all paths are repo-relative or resolved via
# main-root-lib.sh's own resolvers. Guarded so double-sourcing is a no-op.

# Absolute path to the append-only JSON Lines ledger, rooted at ROOT (the
# per-tree root a caller has already resolved, typically via Pattern T's
# payload-anchored gaia_resolve_tree_root) and keyed to that same ROOT's own
# gaia_tree_key, so the ledger lands under a tree-keyed subpath even once a
# worktree's whole .gaia/local becomes one symlink to main's. Defaults to
# gaia_resolve_tree_root of the process cwd when no ROOT is supplied. The key
# is always derived from ROOT itself, never from the process cwd, so a
# caller's own root resolution and this function's key agree. The resolver
# is sourced here, deferred into this function's own body (never at source
# time), matching red_ledger_path's own "no side effects at source time"
# contract.
