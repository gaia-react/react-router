# Absolute path to the append-only JSON Lines ledger, rooted at ROOT (the
# per-tree root a caller has already resolved, typically via Pattern T's
# payload-anchored gaia_resolve_tree_root) and keyed to that same ROOT's own
# gaia_tree_key, so the ledger lands under a tree-keyed subpath even once a
# worktree's whole .gaia/local becomes one symlink to main's. Defaults to
# gaia_resolve_tree_root of the process cwd when no ROOT is supplied. The key
# is always derived from ROOT itself, never from the process cwd, so a
# caller's own root resolution and this function's key agree. The resolver
# is sourced here, deferred into this function's own body (never at source
# time) and on EVERY path -- the no-root branch needs it for
# gaia_resolve_tree_root, the explicit-root branch needs it for
# gaia_tree_key -- so this lib's "no side effects at source time" contract
# holds, matching state-registry-lib.sh's own gaia_registry_path.
