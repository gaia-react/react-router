# Captures a code-review-audit run as a standalone kind:"review" cost.jsonl
# record. One script serves BOTH end-of-context triggers so the review-tally
# logic lives in one place:
#   1. PostToolUse Bash hook on `gh pr merge` (the pre-merge gate run).
#   2. Stop hook (ad-hoc / quality-gate runs that end without a merge).
#
# Both call token-tally.sh --action review, which owns window detection,
# per-run dedup by review_id, the spurious no-op when no code-review-audit
# ran, and the standalone record write. This hook only cheap-gates and
# resolves association; it never parses transcripts and never dedups.
#
# Both triggers can fire in one merge session: the merge trigger records the
# run first, the Stop trigger's tally call finds it already recorded (by
# review_id) and writes nothing. That guarantee lives inside token-tally.sh,
# not here. This hook always exits 0; it never blocks and never emits a
# permission decision.
