# PreToolUse Bash hook: DENY `git commit` when a new-at-HEAD test that now
# passes has no observed failing run (RED) on record matching its current
# content. This is the "deny the consequential action" half of mechanical TDD
# RED-verification: the sibling capture hook (capture-red-observations.sh)
# records REDs at test-run time; this hook enforces them at commit. It mirrors
# pr-merge-audit-check.sh: a PreToolUse Bash deny gating the least-reversible
# action on a recorded marker keyed to content.
#
# The check is a LEDGER LOOKUP + a SIGNAL RECOMPUTE. It never re-runs tests;
# husky's `test:lint-staged` remains the GREEN confirmation. For each staged
# test file that is new/modified at HEAD, it computes the set of CURRENT tests
# (working-tree content) and the set that existed at HEAD, then demands a
# matching valid RED only for tests whose fullName is NEW at HEAD. Edits,
# renames, and refactors of tests already present at HEAD are out of scope and
# never demand a fresh RED.
#
# Scope is driven entirely by the signal helper's emitted current-test set.
# Tests with dynamic titles (template-literal/computed names, test.each rows
# templated with substitutions) emit NO signal from the helper, so they never
# appear in the current-test set and are therefore EXEMPT by construction: an
# uncomputable identity yields no RED demand, matching the SPEC's fail-open
# posture for uncomputable identity and its "edits/refactors never demand a
# RED" spirit. A new dynamic-title test passing on first run is not blocked.
#
# Type-only tests are EXEMPT for a distinct, principled reason: the helper tags
# each test kind=type-only when its assertions are all type-level (expectTypeOf
# /assertType, or a `@ts-expect-error` proof) with no runtime expectation. Such
# a test has no runtime failure mode, so there is no runtime red-green for this
# gate to verify; the `tsc` Quality Gate step enforces it instead. This is the
# correctly-keyed exemption (no runtime assertion), as opposed to the
# dynamic-title carve-out above, which is keyed to uncomputable identity.
#
# Emergent-subject tests are EXEMPT too: the RED demand is scoped to the
# DETERMINISTIC surface via the determinism classifier
# (.gaia/scripts/classifier/classify-determinism.mjs). A test whose subject is
# clock-/entropy-/I-O-bound or tree-dependent (component interaction, async,
# layout, E2E) has no stable failing-then-passing run to observe, so demanding a
# RED produces theater. Such a file is skipped; the deterministic surface still
# demands its RED. See the carve-out block below for the binding and its
# err-EMERGENT, non-tightening fail-open.
#
# Fail-open vs fail-closed (threat model: a cooperative-but-fallible agent):
#   - git / jq / node unavailable  -> exit 0 (allow). Sibling-hook posture.
#   - a staged test file the helper cannot parse (mid-edit syntax error)
#     -> that file is skipped, never denied (husky's GREEN gate and the
#        agent's own run surface the syntax error). Fail-open.
#   - the determinism classifier unavailable or erroring -> the carve-out
#     does NOT fire; the file falls back to the pre-carve RED demand. This keeps
#     the deterministic path intact and never relaxes the gate on uncertainty.
#   - the deny path is fail-closed ONLY for the clean case: a parseable
#     new-at-HEAD passing test with no matching valid RED in the ledger that the
#     classifier does not label emergent.
#
# -e is intentionally omitted: we must not abort before writing the deny JSON.
# All error-prone commands are individually guarded (|| true, 2>/dev/null) so a
# transient failure can never crash the hook into a default-allow that skips
# the gate for the clean case, nor a default-deny that blocks honest work.

#
# Binding: classify the TEST FILE ITSELF with the determinism classifier
# (.gaia/scripts/classifier/classify-determinism.mjs). The classifier already
# carries every emergent signal this gate cares about and is biased err-EMERGENT:
#   - a `.tsx` test under app/components/** (component interaction) and a

#   - a test calling the a11y helpers (expectNoA11yViolations / runAxe) -> emergent;
#   - a test reading the clock/entropy/I-O in its own body -> emergent.
# The classifier's internal err-EMERGENT bias supplies the "treat as emergent
# when we cannot prove the subject deterministic" posture: anything it cannot
# confidently prove deterministic it returns emergent, and an emergent verdict
# relaxes the RED demand for that file.
#
# Fail-open / non-tightening: when the classifier is unavailable or errors, the
# gate falls back to its pre-carve behavior (demand the RED) so the deterministic
# path is never broken and the existing fail-open posture is preserved exactly.

These tests are new at HEAD and pass now, but no matching RED was recorded for the current test body. A passing test that was never seen failing first does not prove the test can fail; that is the gap this gate closes.

To unblock:
  1. Run \`pnpm test --run\` and confirm the test FAILS (RED) before the change that makes it pass.
  2. Then make the change that turns it green and commit.

A RED is bound to the test's comment-free content: rewording a comment inside a test leaves the signal unchanged and the RED still counts, but any change to what the test executes invalidates that RED, so a fresh failing run must be observed for the current body. Edits, renames, and refactors of tests already present at HEAD are out of scope and never demand a RED."
