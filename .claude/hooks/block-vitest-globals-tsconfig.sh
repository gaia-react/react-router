# Any .json whose name carries tsconfig, anywhere in the segment: a split
# tsconfig.node.json / tsconfig.app.json pair makes describe/expect ambient
# exactly as the root config does, and tsc reads whatever config `-p` or
# `extends` names, so a non-canonical name can be a live one. Deliberately
# generous rather than anchored to a known set of spellings, on both ends of the
# name: enumerating separators is unbounded, and over-blocking costs one message
# carrying a remedy where under-blocking costs the ambient-types erosion this
# guard exists to stop. `[^/]*` is the one limit that holds, keeping the pattern
# inside a single path segment so a directory named tsconfig does not pull every
# .json beneath it in. Case-insensitive for the same reason the content match
# below is: on a case-insensitive filesystem TSConfig.json resolves to the real
# config, so a case-sensitive path match is a bypass rather than a cosmetic gap.
