# GAIA-owned Stop hook (merged: session-stop + safety-net).
#
# Two reminders share one git/jq pass:
#   1. WIKI_CHANGED, wiki/ files committed this session → prompt to refresh hot.md.
#   2. End-of-session safety net, session committed but wiki/.state.json did not
#      fully advance → nag to /gaia-wiki sync.
#
# Upstream contract: claude-obsidian/hooks/hooks.json::Stop. Why GAIA overrides:
# upstream diffs working tree vs HEAD, but its PostToolUse already auto-commits
# wiki/ changes, so its Stop diff is always empty and the refresh prompt never
# fires. We diff a session-start HEAD marker against HEAD instead. Reminder text
# uses GAIA's 200-word hot-cache cap (upstream caps at 500).

# upstream `git log` takes SIGPIPE and exits 141, and `pipefail` promotes that
# to the pipeline's status -- so the `if` would take the FALSE branch BECAUSE a
# wiki path matched. A session's whole changed-path set is exactly the input
# that outruns the pipe buffer, and an early `wiki/` match is exactly the
# session this reminder exists for. `.gaia/scripts/lint-sigpipe-readers.sh` is
# the gate that keeps the shape from coming back.
