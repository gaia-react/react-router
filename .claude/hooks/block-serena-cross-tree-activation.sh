#!/usr/bin/env bash
# PreToolUse mcp__serena__activate_project hook: deny an activate_project call
# whose target is a DIFFERENT tree of this clone than the one the session acts
# in.
#
# Serena is registered without --project-from-cwd, so activate_project is
# exposed and no project auto-activates: every session must call it, by name
# or by absolute path. A NAME resolves through Serena's own machine-global
# registry (~/.serena/serena_config.yml, a list of absolute project paths,
# each carrying a project_name from its own .serena/project.yml) to whichever
# checkout registered that name. .serena/project.yml is tracked, so every
# linked worktree of this clone carries the SAME name -- and the registry
# entry that name resolves to is whichever checkout registered first, in
# practice the main checkout. A session working in a linked worktree that
# activates by that bare name therefore gets every subsequent symbol answer
# resolved against main's files, silently: no error, no indication, and a
# session that never notices because the tool call itself succeeded. The path
# form of the same call is exposed to the identical mistake in reverse: a
# stale absolute path left over from another tree, or copy-pasted from
# elsewhere, activates that tree instead of this one, just as silently.
#
# Tree identity comes from the one shared resolver, so this guard never
# re-derives "which tree am I in":
#
#   Whose working directory: the payload's `cwd` field, honored on the same
#   terms as block-worktree-path-mismatch.sh's own treatment -- absolute and
#   resolving to a checkout, or the hook's own process cwd otherwise. The
#   absolute requirement is load-bearing for the same reason there: the value
#   reaches a bare `cd` that would option-parse a leading dash and succeed
#   into the wrong directory.
#
#   Which tree: .gaia/scripts/main-root-lib.sh's gaia_resolve_tree_root, the
#   per-tree counterpart of gaia_resolve_main_root -- the acting tree's own
#   root, physically resolved, whether that tree is main or a linked
#   worktree.
#
# Two arms, because the argument to `project` is either a path or a name:
#
#   PATH arm: the argument physically resolves to a checkout of the SAME
#   clone as the acting tree, but a different one -- the main checkout or a
#   sibling worktree. Symmetric by design: it holds whether the session acts
#   in the main checkout or a linked worktree, because "activate the tree you
#   are in" is true both ways.
#
#   NAME arm: the argument is a bare name. Applies only from inside a linked
#   worktree -- in the main checkout the bare name IS the correct activation,
#   because the registry resolves it there. Denied only when the name equals
#   the acting tree's own .serena/project.yml project_name, the one shape
#   that is provably wrong: that name resolves through the registry to a
#   DIFFERENT checkout (main), never to this one.
#
# What this guard does NOT cover: it cannot see which project Serena has
# already activated, so it adjudicates the activation CALL, not the answer a
# later symbol query gives -- a session that activated before this guard
# existed, or before this file was added, is not retro-corrected. It also
# cannot stop a name Serena's registry has not yet registered for this
# clone's own checkouts; that is not the failure mode described above, which
# needs an existing collision to fire.
#
# Fail-open, matching the other block-*.sh guards: any ambiguity (identity
# undeterminable, jq or the resolver unavailable, a target that does not
# resolve) allows the call rather than blocking a legitimate activation on an
# identity it could not confirm.

#
# The load parse-checks rather than carrying a trailing `|| exit 0`. Under
# `set -e` a failed `.` abandons the shell ahead of that arm, and the two ways
# it fails do not cost the same. Bash cannot open the file: the shell exits 1,
# which a PreToolUse hook reports as an advisory, so the activation proceeds
# unadjudicated with a raw diagnostic on stderr. That is the 3.2.57 stock macOS
# ships as /bin/bash; 5.x reaches the arm instead. Bash opens the file but
# cannot parse it, a lib left holding conflict markers: the shell exits 2, the
# deny code, so this fail-open guard denies the activation instead of allowing it.
#
# Both halves are 3.2-only, and it is the arm that makes them so: bash 5 lets
# the failed source's status reach `|| exit 0` for an unparseable lib exactly
# as it does for a missing one, measured both ways on 3.2.57 and 5.3.15. What
# separates the two halves is the exit code, 1 advisory against 2 deny, not
# their platform reach; only a bare `.` carrying no arm at all dies on both
# shells. The bats cases below are pinned to /bin/bash for that reason, and
# dropping the pin would green them against the spelling this replaced.
# `bash -n` answers both questions in one call and subsumes an existence test. This load sits past the tool-name
# and argument gates above, so the fork is paid only on a real activation.
# What degrades in the arm's place is the `type` check below.
