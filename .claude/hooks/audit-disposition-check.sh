# PreToolUse Bash hook: DENY `gh pr merge` when the disposition-ledger sidecar
# for HEAD's frontend content digest claims a disposition that does not hold,
# or when a valid frontend marker exists but its sidecar has gone missing.
# This is the DETERMINISTIC backstop for the audit's forced-disposition
# guarantee: the code-audit-frontend agent's own verify-after-file re-query is
# the primary enforcer, but that is agent behavior, not code. This hook
# re-reads the disposition-ledger sidecar
# (.gaia/local/audit/<frontend-digest>.dispositions.json) and fails the merge
# by CODE when a marker's claimed dispositions do not check out, or when a
# valid marker's sidecar is absent.
#
# It sits ALONGSIDE pr-merge-audit-check.sh (the marker-existence gate) and
# worthiness-presence-check.sh: all three gate `gh pr merge` and deny
# independently. This hook never relaxes the marker-existence gate; it adds an
# orthogonal check.
#
# DENY conditions:
#   1. A `filed` sidecar entry whose dedup key has NO matching `tech-debt` issue
#      (open OR closed) on a REACHABLE backend (the marker claims a filing that
#      does not exist). A CLOSED match means the disposition was filed and later
#      fixed/closed by /gaia-debt (a fully honored disposition) -> satisfied,
#      so it is NOT an offender.
#   2. A `pending` entry with pending_reason "definitive" (a present, writable
#      backend with a genuinely-missing disposition; a marker should not exist,
#      but defend against a hand-written one).
#   3. A `machinery_waived` entry whose key `path=` is in NEITHER the
#      gate-machinery set (per audit_path_is_machinery) NOR the set of files
#      this pull request already changes (the abuse-check: the machinery-waive
#      disposition is sanctioned only for a finding whose path is gate
#      machinery or a file the pull request itself touches, so an entry outside
#      that union is an unfiled out-of-scope finding wearing a machinery
#      label). It reads no issue backend for this term: the changed-files
#      set comes from a git diff of the acting tree, dropping only that
#      term (deciding on the gate-machinery term alone) when the diff base
#      cannot be resolved. Which branch that diff is taken against is the
#      pull request's own base, so the derivation does consult the pull
#      request record when Actions has not already supplied it, and every
#      failure there degrades to a purely local answer. Fails open, producing no offenders at all, when the
#      machinery library cannot be resolved.
#   4. The frontend earned marker for the current frontend digest is VALID
#      (present, writer-shaped, provenance earned) but its sidecar is ABSENT.
#      Every audit run, including one that identifies zero out-of-scope
#      findings, writes a sidecar (an empty findings list at minimum), so an
#      absent sidecar alongside a valid marker means the sidecar was lost, not
#      that nothing was ever filed. Digest keying makes this a fail-open the
#      old whole-tree key never exposed; this arm closes it.
#   5. The frontend content digest cannot be derived (a missing sha256 tool, an
#      unloadable classifier/machinery library, a failing `git ls-tree`, or an
#      absent digest library). A digest-keyed gate that cannot compute its own
#      key has no path to check, so it denies rather than fall through to a
#      permissive exit.
#
# FAIL-OPEN everywhere else (the never-block invariant): no frontend marker at
# all (or one present but not writer-shaped/valid for the current digest),
# backend "absent", every `filed` entry confirmed present, all entries
# diverted/waived/pending(transient)/machinery_waived-on-an-eligible-path
# (gate machinery or a file this pull request changes), or ANY gh/tooling
# failure (no gh, unauthenticated, timeout, rate-limit, 5xx, unresolved repo).
# The backstop blocks ONLY on a confirmed present-backend inconsistency, a
# pending(definitive) entry, a machinery_waived entry whose path is neither
# gate machinery nor a file this pull request changes, a
# valid-marker-with-absent-sidecar mismatch, or an undivertable digest-derive
# failure.
#
# Key relationship: the sidecar `key` is the dedup-key INNER content
# `v1 class=… path=… line=…` WITHOUT the `<!-- gaia-debt-key: … -->` wrapper;
# the filed issue body carries the wrapped form. A match reconstructs the
# WRAPPED form `<!-- gaia-debt-key: ${key} -->` and tests the issue body for it
# as a SUBSTRING, never whole-line equality. The wrapped form is collision-safe:
# the bare inner key ends in `line=<int>` with no boundary, so a `line=4` key
# would substring-match a sibling `line=42 -->` issue; the trailing ` -->`
# prevents that digit-prefix false match.

Offending finding key(s):

${offender_list}

A marker for this content asserts every out-of-scope finding has a real disposition, but:
  - filed-but-missing: the sidecar marks the finding 'filed' yet no OPEN or CLOSED tech-debt issue carries its key on the reachable backend.
  - pending(definitive): the finding has no disposition (a definitive filing failure on a present, writable backend).
  - machinery-waived-not-eligible: the sidecar waives the finding as gate machinery or as a file this pull request already changes, but its key path is neither (the machinery-waive disposition is sanctioned only for a gate-machinery path or a path this pull request itself changes).

To unblock a filed-but-missing or pending(definitive) offender:
  1. Re-run the local code-audit-frontend agent on this HEAD so it re-files the
     missing disposition (filing is idempotent; an already-filed key is not
     duplicated).
  2. Let it rewrite the disposition-ledger sidecar and the marker.
  3. Retry gh pr merge.

To unblock a machinery-waived-not-eligible offender:
  1. If the pull request should still be changing that file and a plain revert
     commit dropped it from the diff, restore the change and retry. The
     eligibility set is the fork point against HEAD, and HEAD moves.
  2. Otherwise the finding is ordinary out-of-scope debt and takes its normal
     filing path: delete the stale entry from ${sidecar} (gitignored working
     state; no other file records it) and re-run the audit so it is filed as a
     tech-debt issue.
  3. Re-running the member with the entry in place reproduces the same waive
     and the same denial.

This is a deterministic backstop for the audit's forced-disposition guarantee;
it never blocks on a backend-absent or transient condition.
