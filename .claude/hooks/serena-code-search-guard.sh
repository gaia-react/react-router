# Serena code-search guard (PreToolUse, matcher: Grep, Bash).
#
# Routes symbol-level searches to Serena's LSP-backed MCP tools instead of
# ripgrep. The routing RULE lives in .claude/rules/code-search.md, but that rule
# is path-scoped to app/** and test/** EDITS, so it is usually not in context
# during exploration, which is exactly when the grep-vs-Serena decision gets
# made. This hook fires at the moment of the search call, closing that gap.
#
# BEHAVIOR: when the pattern is a bare identifier searched over indexed TS/TSX
# source, the search is blocked (exit 2) with a message pointing at Serena's
# find_symbol / find_referencing_symbols / get_symbols_overview. A bare
# identifier over source is a "where is X / what calls X" query, precisely what
# Serena answers with type resolution where grep only string-matches.
#
# TWO MATCHERS, ONE SCRIPT. The Grep tool exposes its pattern/path/glob/type as
# structured fields; the Bash tool exposes only a raw command line, so real
# symbol searches also arrive as shell grep/rg/ag. Branch on .tool_name:
#   - Grep -> read .tool_input.pattern/path/glob/type (structured gates below).
#   - Bash -> read .tool_input.command and fire only on a SINGLE grep/rg/ag
#     invocation whose lone pattern is a bare identifier scoped to app/** or
#     test/** TS/TSX. The Bash detection is deliberately shallow and biased
#     toward allowing: a pipeline, a sequenced or compound command, a command
#     substitution, a redirection, a quoted/regex/multi-word pattern, multiple
#     patterns, a non-TS scope, or a scope that cannot be resolved to app/test
#     source all pass through. Blocking legitimate shell work is worse than
#     missing a symbol grep, so every ambiguous case allows.
#   - any other tool -> allow (never seen in practice).
#
# ESCAPE (block-once): re-running the IDENTICAL search within 2 minutes passes.
# Genuine string-literal / comment / cross-language searches that happen to be
# identifier-shaped are rare; the re-run lets them through without a permanent
# wall, honoring the "safe direction is to allow" posture of the sibling guards.
#
# ADOPTER SAFETY: no-ops silently unless Serena is actually registered as an MCP
# server (user scope in ~/.claude.json, or project .mcp.json) AND the repo has a
# tsconfig.json for Serena to index. Adopters without Serena never see it.
#
# ONE CASE SITS AHEAD OF THAT, and it is the whole fail-closed layer's, not this
# hook's alone: with no jq on PATH the registration check below cannot run at
# all, because it reads its answer with jq. The arm reached first then refuses a
# command carrying one of its literals rather than standing down, so on such a
# machine an adopter with no Serena does see it, once, with the install
# instruction. That is the settled posture for every blocking hook in the layer
# (.claude/hooks/lib/jq-availability.sh); a jq-less machine is one where nothing
# here can honor its own preconditions, and saying so loudly beats deciding the
# call is allowed without reading it.
#
# CONSERVATIVE BY DESIGN: fires only on a bare identifier (>= 3 chars, no spaces,
# quotes, dots, or regex metacharacters) whose scope is not narrowed away from
# TS/TSX source. Prose, string literals, and real regexes never pass the pattern
# gate. Any ambiguity resolves toward allowing the search.
#
# No `set -e`: this is a routing guard, not a security gate. On any parse failure
# the checks resolve empty and the search is allowed.

input=$(cat)

# jq-availability arm: refuse loudly rather than fail open when the interpreter
# this hook reads its payload with is absent. What that buys, and the contract
# the literals below satisfy, live in .claude/hooks/lib/jq-availability.sh.
# No errexit bracket around the source: this hook runs under no `set` options at
# all, per the header above.
#
# The literals are `grep`, `rg` and `ag`, read off the Bash branch's own command
# word requirement below. Their ABSENCE from the command proves the call is not
# a shell symbol search and it is allowed, exactly as a tokenized non-match is.
# Presence is not proof of membership -- `ag` inside "package" or "storage"
# satisfies it -- and that over-deny is the safe direction for the Bash matcher,
# which is the one that reaches the jq install.
#
# WHAT THE LITERALS CANNOT REACH, and why that is the right direction here. A
# Grep-tool payload carries a pattern, and nothing about a bare identifier names
# any of the three, so an in-remit Grep call is ALLOWED rather than refused when
# jq is gone. That is under-deny on the Grep half, and it is deliberate: this
# hook is a routing nudge whose own published posture is that every ambiguity
# resolves toward allowing the search (header above), so a missed reminder is
# the cost its contract already accepts, while refusing every Grep call on a
# machine with no jq would trade that reminder for a blocked session. The
# fail-closed half of the layer is the Bash branch, and the literals cover it.

BLOCKED (serena-code-search guard): "$pattern" is a bare identifier searched
over TS/TSX source, i.e. a symbol query. Serena resolves these against the
language server; grep only string-matches.

Use Serena instead:
  - find_symbol               where "$pattern" is defined, and its type
  - find_referencing_symbols  what calls / imports "$pattern"
  - get_symbols_overview      the symbol shape of a file or module

Genuinely searching a string literal, comment, JSX text, or across languages?
Re-run the IDENTICAL grep and it will pass.
