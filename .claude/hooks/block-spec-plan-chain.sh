#!/usr/bin/env bash
# PreToolUse + SessionStart hook: a session that authored a SPEC may not go on
# to plan it. /gaia-spec ends with a very large context (Socratic loop, gate
# renders, self-review, adversarial audit); /gaia-plan's deep synthesis needs a
# clean one. So the handoff is a copy-pasteable prompt the human runs in a fresh
# session, never an in-session chain.
#
# spec.md has said "print the handoff and stop" in prose since the flow was
# written, and the model still chains anyway: when /gaia-spec is invoked as a
# skill rather than typed by the human, the driving agent carries an outer goal
# ("spec and build X") that outlives the skill body, and step 11's stop reads as
# a suggestion. Prose cannot hold a boundary the agent has a standing reason to
# cross. This makes it deterministic.
#
# HOW IT WORKS. Both commands are thin dispatchers whose body is "Read
# .claude/skills/gaia/references/<x>.md and follow it exactly", so every entry
# path, human or model, funnels through tool calls this hook sees:
#
#   STAMP (a spec session is underway; allow, never block):
#     - Skill        whose skill NAME (never its arguments) resolves to gaia-spec
#     - Bash         INVOKING lib/spec-allocator.sh, i.e. the path followed by one
#                    of its own subcommands (the SPEC-id allocation every
#                    /gaia-spec path runs: fresh, resume, and auto). Merely naming
#                    the allocator (a grep, a shellcheck, a git log, this hook's
#                    own tests) is not an invocation and must never stamp.
#   DENY (that stamp is live for this session_id):
#     - Skill        whose skill name resolves to gaia-plan
#     - Read         of .claude/skills/gaia/references/plan.md
#
# The sentinel is keyed on session_id, so the guard is scoped to the session
# that ran /gaia-spec and is inert everywhere else: a fresh session may invoke
# /gaia-plan by any route, including the model's own natural-language dispatch.
#
# WHY NOT STAMP ON A Read OF spec.md. It is the other obvious chokepoint, but
# audit runbooks cite spec.md step 7 AND plan.md step 4.6 as the canonical
# audit pattern, so an audit session reads both references and would deny
# itself. An allocator INVOCATION carries no such ambiguity: nothing
# allocates a SPEC id except a live authoring session. The distinction is the
# whole point, and it is load-bearing in the other direction too, since a
# maintainer session that greps or lints the allocator (a shell audit, a fitness
# run) must not be read as authoring and lose /gaia-plan for a SPEC it never
# wrote. A false stamp is a false deny one step later, so the stamp arm is held
# to the same fail-open standard as everything else here.
#
# STRICT BY DESIGN. A PreToolUse hook cannot distinguish a human-typed
# /gaia-plan from a model-initiated one at the Read chokepoint (a typed slash
# command expands at the prompt level and reaches no tool, but the Read of
# plan.md it provokes is identical either way). The block therefore holds for
# both, which is the stated policy: planning is always a new session. The
# correct path is one keystroke away, /clear drops the sentinel (the
# SessionStart arm below), and the deny names it.
#
# RESIDUAL GAPS (documented, not bugs): an agent that reads plan.md through Bash
# (`cat`/`sed`) rather than the Read tool, or that reconstructs planning ad hoc
# without reading plan.md at all, is not caught. A Bash arm was considered and
# rejected: matching plan.md in a command string denies innocent greps for
# "gaia-plan" (an audit, this very hook's own tests), and the false-positive
# cost outweighs a vector no observed misfire has used. Prose covers the rest,
# spec.md's Hard constraint 6 and step 11.
#
# Best-effort, never a sandbox: always exits 0, carrying the decision in stdout
# JSON. Any ambiguity (no git, no session_id, unparseable payload) falls through
# to allow, an authoring session that cannot be proven is never blocked.
# Policy: wiki/concepts/GAIA Spec.md (step 11).
