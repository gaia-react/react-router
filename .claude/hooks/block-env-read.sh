# PreToolUse Read + Grep + Bash hook: read-side secret guard for dotenv files.
#
# This hook is the WHOLE read-side guard for dotenv paths. It carries no
# settings.json backstop behind it, and that is deliberate: a Read() deny rule
# in permissions.deny arms Claude Code's deniedPathInsideDirectory circuit
# breaker, which is bypass-immune and forces a manual approval prompt for every
# grep, rg, diff, git, cp and mv whose target directory could contain a denied
# path -- which, for a rule written with a `**` glob, is every directory in the
# tree. The prompt is unconditional and cannot be waived by an allow rule, so
# the cost is paid on every recursive search forever. Moving the whole
# obligation here buys that back. What it costs is stated honestly below.
#
# What this guard covers:
#   - the Read tool against .env and any variant (.env.local, .env.production,
#     .env.<anything>), excluding the committed .env.example placeholder;
#   - the Grep tool's `path` and `glob`, which in content mode return file
#     contents and so read a path exactly as Read does;
#   - Bash readers against the same set: cat, head, tail, sed, xxd, od,
#     hexdump, strings, nl, less, more, diff, cut, tac, paste, awk, perl, and
#     the grep family (grep, egrep, fgrep, rgrep, rg);
#   - sourcing (source / .), redirection from a dotenv path (< / $(<...)), and
#     `env FOO=1 <reader> <path>`, where env runs a reader rather than dumping;
#   - bare process-environment dumps (env, printenv, set, export -p, declare -p,
#     compgen -v) that read the shell environment rather than a file, so no
#     file-permission rule ever governed them.
#
# The grep family needs argument grammar rather than a token sweep, because
# `grep PATTERN FILE` puts a non-path in first position and `grep '.env'
# .gitignore` must stay allowed. That grammar lives in lib/reader-operands.sh
# and is shared with block-secrets-read.sh rather than written twice.
#
# HONEST LIMITS. This is heuristic defense-in-depth, not a sandbox: it
# pattern-matches command text and can be evaded by determined obfuscation. It
# does not reach MCP-mediated shell execution (e.g. Serena's
# execute_shell_command), a subprocess that opens the file itself (a Node or
# Python script reading it directly), or a deliberately obfuscated reader.
#
# ONE MORE SPELLING IS OPEN AND IS NONE OF THOSE. The operand walk splits a
# segment on whitespace before quotes are stripped, so a quoted path CONTAINING
# A SPACE arrives as two fragments and neither one strips to the real path:
# `cat "my .env.local"` is allowed where `cat my\ .env.local` is denied.
# Coalescing the fragments is tokenizer work rather than a table entry, and a
# half-done tokenizer is how the flag tables above went wrong, so it is named
# here instead of guessed at. Treat this list as the spellings known to be open,
# never as a closed set.
#
# THE GUARD ALSO DENIES ONE THING IT SHOULD NOT, which the list above cannot
# express because every entry there is a read that gets through. The Bash arm
# splits command text on its character set with no regard for shell quoting, so
# a bare `env` sitting inside a quoted regex becomes a segment whose only word
# is `env`. check_dump_tokens reads that as a bare process dump carrying no
# command operand and denies the whole tool call, naming an environment dump the
# operator never wrote: an ordinary search such as a grep whose alternation
# happens to contain the word is refused, with reason text that misdescribes the
# cause. The direction is fail-closed and no secret escapes, so it is recorded
# rather than repaired here; the repair is either a split that does not start a
# segment from inside a quoted string, or a dump word that must sit in a real
# command position before check_dump_tokens rules on it. Both are the same
# tokenizer work the spelling above defers, and rewriting the alternation with
# repeated `-e` operands is the workaround in the meantime.
#
# THE PERMISSION RULE SHARED ALL OF THOSE LIMITS AT THE TOOL TIER, and it had
# one this hook cannot have. A Read() deny merges into the OS sandbox boundary,
# so `Read(.env)` also denied a subprocess spawned by sandboxed Bash, including
# the app's own tooling when Claude ran it. A hook sees tool-call text and never
# a subprocess open(), so deleting the rule would have dropped that tier in
# silence for every adopter who enabled the sandbox. It is declared directly
# instead: `sandbox.filesystem.denyRead` in .claude/settings.json now carries
# .env and its variants. That key is not a permission rule, so it does not arm
# the breaker, and it is inert until a machine enables the sandbox, which is the
# owner-recommends / machine-resolves split `wiki/concepts/OS Sandbox.md` sets
# out. At the tool tier, which is this hook's tier, the exchange costs no
# coverage that was real.
