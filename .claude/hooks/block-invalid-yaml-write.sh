# PreToolUse Edit/Write/MultiEdit hook: deny a YAML-bearing write (a
# .yml/.yaml file, or Markdown --- frontmatter) that newly breaks the YAML
# region it targets, valid before this call, invalid after.
#
# tech-debt gaia-react/gaia#867: Claude repeatedly authors invalid YAML plain scalars, most
# often a mid-sentence ": " (read as a mapping-key separator) or a stray " #"
# (read as a comment, silently truncating the value), and only discovers it
# when a downstream parser or lint fails, sometimes on an already-saved
# immutable artifact. .specify/extensions/gaia/lib/lint.sh catches the same
# class in SPEC frontmatter, but only at save-time, after the round trip this
# hook exists to prevent, and only for one surface; this hook is structural
# (any .yml/.yaml, any .md carrying --- frontmatter) rather than a directory
# allowlist, since the highest-frequency case (frontmatter inside .md) is
# exactly what a naive extension-only scope misses.
#
# Regression-only, never a blanket validity gate: this hook compares the
# region's state before and after the call and denies only a valid -> invalid
# transition this call itself causes. A repo scan while authoring this hook
# found pre-existing broken frontmatter already sitting in several tracked
# files; a "the resulting file must be valid" rule would have permanently
# locked out any further, unrelated edit to those files. Regression-only
# means the hook never blocks a file already broken by prior debt.
#
# Detect and pinpoint only, never auto-heal: a malformed scalar's intended
# form (quote it vs. it was meant to be a mapping key) is not provable from
# the parse failure alone, so the agent repairs it; this hook only says where
# and why.
#
# Fail-open, matching the other block-*.sh guards: no python3+pyyaml, an
# Edit/MultiEdit target that doesn't exist yet, or an old_string this hook
# can't locate in the current file all allow the call rather than blocking a
# legitimate edit on a heuristic miss.
