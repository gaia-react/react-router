# UserPromptSubmit hook: detect drift between wiki/.state.json and HEAD,
# inject a once-per-session reminder if drifted.
#
# Why: the wiki only stays accurate if drift is surfaced. Hooks are read-only
# consumers of state; only /gaia-wiki sync writes wiki/.state.json. See
# wiki/concepts/Wiki Sync.md for the full contract.

# GAIA CI deferral. When wiki.mode == "ci", local automatic triggers stand
# down so they don't collide with the cron-managed wiki run. The marker is
# NOT advanced here so a future config change still gets the drift check.
# Bracketed in `set +e` because errexit is armed above: an unparseable copy (an
# unresolved merge conflict, a truncated write) would otherwise abandon the hook
# at the load, before the `type` check below can degrade it to "not managed".
# Rooted at this file's own on-disk location, never at the process working
# directory: a bare test is false from anywhere below the repository root, and
# the `type` check reads that as a missing library. Through the ancestor rather
# than a lib child, for the reason block-main-destructive-git.sh states at the
# same load: the ancestor cannot fail, so no degrade branch is owed.
