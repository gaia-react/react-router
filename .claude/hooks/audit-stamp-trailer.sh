#!/usr/bin/env bash
# audit-stamp-trailer.sh, write the GAIA-Audit commit trailer on HEAD.
#
# Purpose
#   Implements the stamp invariant + stamp placement rule described in
#   .gaia/local/plans/code-review-audit-ci/trailer-format.md. Called by the
#   code-audit-frontend agent (.claude/agents/code-audit-frontend.md) after the
#   audit has decided that an "Audit marker" is warranted. The trailer travels
#   with the commit through the network so CI can skip its own audit run when
#   the trailer's <agent-version> + <frontend-digest> match a CI-recomputed
#   digest of the PR head.
#
# Invocation
#   .claude/hooks/audit-stamp-trailer.sh
#
#   Argument-less. Reads its inputs from the environment + git state.
#
# Required env input
#   AUDIT_TREE_SHA      The tree-sha the audit reviewed (captured at audit
#                       start). When unset/empty the script assumes the
#                       current tree IS the audited tree.
#   AUDIT_SELF_HEALED   "true" iff the audit repaired anything during this run,
#                       working tree or commit. Local passes repair the working
#                       tree and make no commit; CI commits its own self-heal.
#                       Anything else (incl. unset) means the audit was clean.
#
# Exit codes
#   0 , Stamped successfully OR declined (precondition failed). One stdout
#        marker line is always emitted; the audit caller pipes it into its
#        final surface line. Stamp lines:
#          stamp: amended onto HEAD (un-pushed)
#          stamp: amended onto audit-self-heal HEAD
#          stamp: empty commit (created locally)
#        Decline lines (prefix "stamp: declined: "):
#          tree dirty
#          version file missing
#          version file empty
#          tree changed since audit started
#          not in a git repo
#          already stamped
#          frontend digest unavailable
#          clearance reader unavailable
#          frontend holds a live refusal
#          members pending <list>
#          stamp lock contended
#   2 , Usage / unexpected error. Stderr.

# Notes
#   - Bash 3.2 compatible (macOS-default bash). Avoids associative arrays,
#     `${var^^}`, and other 4.x-only features.
#   - Never `cd`s (per .claude/rules/shell-cwd.md). Resolves the repo root via
#     git rev-parse and uses repo-relative paths from there.
#   - Uses `git interpret-trailers --trailer` (git 2.13+) to round-trip the
#     trailer through git's RFC 822 folder.

# Member-aware gate: the trailer certifies that EVERY dispatched Code Audit Team
# member cleared this CONTENT, not just the caller. Mirrors the member-aware
# gate in .claude/hooks/post-audit-status.sh. Each member is keyed to its OWN
# digest (owned files + machinery), not the frontend digest or the tree.
# An ABSENT or non-executable resolver falls back to the caller's own clean
# judgment so a partial or early-resume tree is never bricked (never a
# fail-closed deadlock). ABSENT and FAILED are two different
# states and only the first gets that fallback: a resolver that runs and exits
# non-zero could not resolve the audited root, so the member set is unknown,
# and stamping a trailer that certifies an unknown set is the vacuous pass this
# gate exists to prevent. That arm declines.
#
# The invocation is anchored on $repo_root, the acting tree this hook measures,
# because the resolver derives its own root from cwd. $repo_root is itself a
# toplevel query against the ambient cwd, so the anchor normalizes a run from a
# SUBDIRECTORY up to the checkout root; it cannot repoint the hook at another
# tree. Selecting the tree is the caller's job, done by invoking the hook from
# it.
#
# Two checks sit AHEAD of that branch and hold whether or not a roster resolves,
# so the never-brick fallback can no longer stamp over a refusal it never read.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The refusal reader is required by both of them, probed once here rather than
# per member. A clearance lib carrying clearance_member_cleared without
# clearance_member_refused makes a refusal call exit 127, and the surrounding
# `||` chain consumes that as "not refused", reverting the gate to cleared-only
# and stamping on content where a member holds a live refusal. That is the one
# degradation direction this gate must never take, so an unavailable reader
# declines rather than falling open, matching post-audit-status.sh.
#
# The posture that decides this arm, stated once for both hooks: the trailer is
# an attestation, and an attestation nobody can verify is worse than none. Fail
# closed costs nothing a merge needs, because the trailer is one of several
# independent signals the merge gate reads (pr-merge-audit-check.sh's
# frontend_cleared tries the member's own marker first and the GitHub status
# after), so withholding it leaves those standing rather than bricking anything.

# The refusal that contradicts THIS trailer, read without the roster. Field 2

# write never clears a same-digest refusal (only --supersede-refusal does, as an
# explicit recorded act), so a member that refused this digest and was then
# re-run with a plain earned write holds BOTH artifacts. The member loop below
# catches that for every dispatched member, but it is armed only when the
# resolver is executable, and the no-resolver fallback stamps on the caller's own
# judgment alone. Left to that fallback the trailer asserts a clean pass over a
# live refusal, and CI's whole-team floor anchors a later round past it.
