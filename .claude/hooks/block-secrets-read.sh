# PreToolUse Read + Grep + Bash hook: read-side guard for key, certificate, and
# credential paths. The read-side counterpart to block-secrets-write.sh, which
# judges write CONTENT; this one judges read PATHS.
#
# It carries the obligation four permissions.deny rules used to hold:
#
#   Read(**/*.key)  Read(**/*.pem)  Read(**/*credential*)  Read(**/secrets/*)
#
# Those rules are gone, and this hook exists because of how they failed rather
# than because they were wrong. A `**` Read() deny glob arms Claude Code's
# deniedPathInsideDirectory circuit breaker for EVERY directory in the tree,
# since a `**` pattern can always match something inside any directory. The
# breaker is bypass-immune, so every recursive grep, rg, diff, git, cp and mv
# demanded a manual approval that no allow rule could waive. A guard nobody can
# afford to leave on is not protection. This one costs nothing per command.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS A SECRET PATH, and how it differs from the globs above:
#   - basename ending .key or .pem            (same as the globs)
#   - basename containing "credential"        (CASE-INSENSITIVE; the glob was
#                                              case-sensitive, so this is
#                                              strictly wider)
#   - any path under a directory named secrets (the glob matched only a file
#                                              DIRECTLY inside it, so this is
#                                              strictly wider)
# Both widenings are deliberate. A guard replacing another guard should not be
# the narrower of the two, and neither widening can produce a false deny on a
# path the old rule would have allowed for a good reason.
#
# HONEST LIMITS, and they are the same ones the rules it replaces had: this is
# heuristic defense-in-depth, not a sandbox. It pattern-matches command text and
# can be evaded by obfuscation. It does not reach MCP-mediated shell execution
# (e.g. Serena's execute_shell_command) or a subprocess that opens the file
# itself.
#
# ONE MORE SPELLING IS OPEN AND IS NONE OF THOSE. The operand walk splits a
# segment on whitespace before quotes are stripped, so a quoted path CONTAINING
# A SPACE arrives as two fragments and neither one strips to the real path:
# `cat "my file.key"` is allowed where `cat my\ file.key` is denied. Coalescing
# the fragments is tokenizer work rather than a table entry, and a half-done
# tokenizer is how the flag tables above went wrong, so it is named here instead
# of guessed at. Treat this list as the spellings known to be open, never as a
# closed set.
#
# THE SUBPROCESS TIER IS NOT LOST WITH THE RULES, it moved. A Read() deny rule
# merges into the OS sandbox boundary, so the four globs above also denied a
# subprocess spawned by sandboxed Bash, which no hook can see. Deleting them
# would have dropped that tier silently, so the same four classes are now
# declared directly as `sandbox.filesystem.denyRead` entries in
# .claude/settings.json. That key is not a permission rule and does not arm the
# breaker, and it is inert on a machine that has not enabled the sandbox, which
# is the tier split `wiki/concepts/OS Sandbox.md` describes.
