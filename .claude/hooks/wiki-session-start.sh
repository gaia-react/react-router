# GAIA-owned wiki hook. Upstream contract: claude-obsidian/hooks/hooks.json::SessionStart
# Why GAIA overrides: upstream cats wiki/hot.md and prompts a silent re-read; we
# instead record HEAD so the Stop hook can detect wiki commits (the plugin's own
# Stop diff misses changes already auto-committed by its PostToolUse hook).
# Hot-cache restoration is left to the model + claude-obsidian:wiki skill.
