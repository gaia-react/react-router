# PostToolUse Bash hook: OBSERVE-AND-RECORD half of the RED-verification gate.
#
# When the agent runs a one-shot vitest run (`pnpm test --run [scope]`), this
# hook re-invokes vitest with the json reporter on the same scope, reads the
# per-test results, and appends every GENUINELY-FAILING test to the
# RED-observation ledger (.gaia/local/red-ledger/<tree_key>/observations.jsonl;
# <tree_key> identifies the working tree, printed by
# `bash .gaia/scripts/main-root-lib.sh --tree-key`). The companion check hook
# (red-verify-commit-check.sh) later reads that ledger to decide whether a
# `git commit` introducing a now-passing new test may land.
#
# This hook ONLY observes. It never blocks, never emits a deny, and ALWAYS
# exits 0, a missing capture only means the check may later deny, which is the
# safe direction. It mirrors the merge-audit gate's split of "observe and
# record" from "deny the consequential action."
#
# Valid RED = a per-test `assertionResults[].status == "failed"`. A file-level
# collection/compile error (file status "failed", empty assertionResults,
# non-empty message, no test body ran) is NOT a valid RED and is skipped.
#
# Test seam: set RED_CAPTURE_JSON_OVERRIDE to an existing json file to feed
# canned vitest output and skip the real vitest re-run (used by the bats suite
# so it stays fast and offline). Production never sets it.
#
# -e is intentionally omitted: every fallible command is individually guarded so
# the hook can never abort before its unconditional exit 0.

# command word AND `test` is the script position, requiring the POSITIVE
# `--run` case scoped to that same segment (a bare run is blocked upstream by
# block-bare-test.sh and never reaches a passing PostToolUse). Command TEXT that
# merely mentions the phrase (a commit message, a `--body` string) is not an
# invocation, so a spurious full-suite vitest re-run never fires on prose.
# `test:ci` / `test:lint-staged` carry a `test:` token, not a bare `test`, so
# the `test([[:space:]]|$)` boundary skips them, aligned with the bare-test hook.
# $test_seg is the matched invocation with its env prefix stripped; the scope
# parse below reads it (not the whole command) so only that call's args count.
