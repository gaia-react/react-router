# PreToolUse Edit/Write hook: deny writes that contain obvious secrets.
#
# Patterns:
#   - AWS access key prefix:   AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}
#   - GitHub PATs:             ghp_, gho_, ghu_, ghs_, ghr_  (followed by token chars)
#   - Private key headers:     -----BEGIN [A-Z ]*PRIVATE KEY-----
#   - dotenv-style assignment to suspicious names, with or without a leading
#     export / declare / typeset / local / readonly and that keyword's own
#     options. In a write whose destination is named `.env.example`, this rule
#     alone drops its placeholder allowlist and judges the value by SHAPE only,
#     the way both sibling env guards already special-case that file; the three
#     rules above still run on it:
#       (_TOKEN|_SECRET|_KEY|_PASSWORD)=<non-placeholder-value>
#       Placeholders allowed: empty, "", '', x, xxx, changeme, REPLACE_ME,
#       TODO, PLACEHOLDER, ${...}, $VAR, and three whole-value shapes:
#       $(...) unnested, <...> with no inner `>`, and a your-* / fake-* /
#       dummy-* / example* placeholder whose every SEGMENT is short
#       (case-insensitive).
#     A shell declaration additionally allows the ordinary expansion forms as
#     whole values: a positional ($1, ${1}), an EMPTY operand (${VAR:-}), a
#     value that is nothing but braced references (${A}${B}), and ${VAR}
#     followed by a segment-bounded path. The value is judged whole FIRST, so a
#     separator inside it (`$(cmd || true)`) is never mistaken for a tail.
#     Only then does a trailing comment or ; && || clause come off, and it is
#     read rather than discarded. The allowlist judges it only where an
#     EXECUTABLE tail's assignment LEADS its fragment, and a `$(…)` in that
#     assignment's value is kept whole the way the primary value's is. Leading a
#     fragment is a property of the SEPARATORS, not of the surrounding syntax:
#     an assignment behind a bare `{`, `(`, or pipe does not lead one and falls
#     back to shape, while the same assignment after a separator INSIDE that
#     group does lead one and is allowlist-judged. One inside a `$(…)` body is
#     judged by neither, since the mask erases the body. A comment tail, and any
#     tail carrying no assignment, fall back to shape too, a 13+ alphanumeric
#     run mixing letters and digits. That bound is on the RUN, not the value, so
#     the honest limit where shape is what runs is that a value whose every
#     alphanumeric run is under 13 or unmixed clears, a segmented secret
#     included.
#
# Rule 4 judges at most 200 matching lines, and at most 65536 characters of
# them, in one write, and denies past either, so the scan cannot outrun the
# hook's own deadline. Two caps because per-line cost is unbounded as well; the
# rationale sits with the checks themselves, above the two loops they bound.

# mask_subs <text>: a SAME-LENGTH copy of <text> whose every unnested `$(…)`
# body is overwritten with `x`. Equal length is the whole point of it. The
# caller locates a cut OFFSET on the copy and applies that offset to the
# original, so the value the allowlist reads is the true one and no arm is ever
# satisfied by masked material.
#
# That is what separates this from the executable tail's own mask below. That
# one feeds the fragments the allowlist judges, so it collapses a body to `$(@)`
# and accepts, in the consequences listed there, that erasing a body erases
# whatever the body held. This one feeds nothing but a position, so it erases
# nothing from any judgement.
#
# It carries the `$(…)` arm's own bound, `[^)]+`: it stops at the first `)` and
# leaves an EMPTY body alone, so `$()` and a nested `$(… $(…) …)` are masked the
# way that arm reads them rather than some other way. An unclosed `$(` ends the
# walk with the remainder passed through untouched, which leaves the caller's
# cut exactly where it already was. That bound is written in three places, here,
# in `value_allowed`'s substitution arm, and in the tail rescan's own mask; they
# have to agree, since each reads the same `$(…)` the others do.
#
# The x-run is taken from a doubling cache rather than from `${body//?/x}`.
# Bash's pattern substitution rescans the whole body per replacement, which is
# quadratic in body length. This registration carries no `timeout`, and a hook
# killed before it reaches its `deny` lets the write through, so that cost is a
# fail-OPEN and the wrong direction for a guard.
#
# `sed 's/./x/g'` also preserves character length, multibyte included, and would
# fix that axis. The cache is used instead because it spawns nothing: the walk's
# own cost is quadratic in the NUMBER of substitutions rather than in body
# length, so a line carrying hundreds of them would pay a process per body on
# top of a cost the x-run never had.
#
# That second axis is bounded by the length cap instead, since no pure-bash walk
# avoids it. Above the cap the mask is the IDENTITY, so the cut is located on the
# raw value and this rule behaves exactly as it does without the mask at all.
#
# For every arm but one, that is a false deny on a pathological line, the
# fail-CLOSED direction the rule already errs in everywhere else. The exception
# is `^<[^>]+>$`, and it follows from the same asymmetry the call site describes:
# reverting to the earlier cut also reverts that arm's allow-to-deny movement, so
# a truncated prefix satisfies it above the cap where the whole value fails it
# below. That admits nothing the rule does not already admit with no mask at all,
# but the cap is not fail-closed in one uniform direction, and lowering it on
# cost grounds means widening that one arm's reach.
#
# SC2016 fires on the `'$('` operands. Not expanding is the whole point, the
# same way it is for the tail mask below: `$(` is the literal two-character
# opener being searched for, and letting it expand would run a substitution
# instead of matching one.

# secret-shaped.

# value_allowed <value>: 0 when the value carries no literal secret. Every arm
# is a shape heuristic, not a proof, and each has to mean "the value is WHOLLY
# this shape" rather than "the value starts or ends like it". Two ways an arm
# loses that meaning, both of which this allowlist has shipped:
#
#   - A delimiter class that swallows its own terminator. `$(.+)` and `<.+>`
#     match `)` / `>` inside the body, so `$(a)<literal>$(b)` and
#     `<a><literal><b>` satisfy anchors that were supposed to certify a whole
#     value. Excluding the terminator from the body is the fix, at the cost of
#     a nested `$(… $(…) …)`, denied, since balanced delimiters need a parser.
#     The `[^)]+` bound that follows from it is written in two more places,
#     `mask_subs`'s walk and the tail rescan's own mask, because both mask the
#     same `$(…)` this arm reads. All three have to agree, so a change to the
#     bound here is a change to all three.
#   - An unanchored tail. `^your[-_]` and `^example` matched a PREFIX, so any
#     secret rode through behind a placeholder-shaped lead-in.
#
# What separates a placeholder from a secret is STRUCTURE, not length: a
# placeholder is short words joined by -_. while a secret is one unbroken
# alphanumeric run. So the placeholder arms bound each SEGMENT rather than the
# whole value, which keeps `your-github-personal-access-token` (long, segmented)
# and rejects `your-aB3xK9pQ7zR2wL5t` (short, unbroken). A length cap gets both
# of those backwards.
#
# None of these read meaning. `$(mint_key)` and `$(echo <a-literal-secret>)`
# are the same shape, so the arm admits both; separating them needs reading
# the command, and this allowlist does not claim to.

# Both loops below are linear in MATCHING-LINE count, and each iteration spawns
# several processes, so one write carrying enough of them runs for minutes. A
# PreToolUse hook that misses its deadline is CANCELLED rather than denied: it
# reports no `permissionDecision` at all, and the write then continues through
# the ordinary permission flow. So an unbounded scan is a fail-OPEN reached by
# input SIZE rather than by input shape, the same axis the length cap inside
# `mask_subs` bounds for the mask.
#
# TWO caps, because there are two axes and a line cap alone bounds neither the
# work nor the deadline. Per-LINE cost is unbounded in its own right: the
# executable-tail rescan splits a tail on `;`, `&&`, and `||` and spawns a grep
# per fragment, so one line carrying thousands of separators costs seconds by
# itself. Capping line count alone leaves their product free, and the product is
# what spends a deadline.
#
# The SIZE cap is the one that bounds the work. It is measured on the MATCHING
# material rather than on the content, because what costs is the judging, and
# the feeder grep skips an ordinary large file before any judging happens. The
# line cap stays alongside it because it names the ordinary case in the terms
# its author will recognize.
#
# What the caps bound is process SPAWNS, not seconds: seconds are one
# machine's unit, where a spawn count is the same regardless of host, just
# costed differently. At the ceiling that is about 40000 spawns, roughly 0.6
# per judged character against the size cap below, and that count is what a
# `timeout` on this registration would have to clear on the SLOWEST machine
# the guard runs on. The caps are what make that worst case a known, bounded
# quantity rather than an open one. This registration carries no `timeout`;
# the runtime's own 600-second default is what holds the deadline out of reach
# today.
#
# This exact bound is pinned from both sides. A boundary pair in the suite spends
# exactly 65536 characters of matching material and asserts ALLOW, then 65537 and
# asserts DENY, so the number here cannot move in either direction, and the
# comparison cannot widen to `-ge`, without a red test.
#
# Three content fixtures set an independent floor under it, and they are why the
# bound is this large rather than merely round. The highest is `a value far over
# the mask cap is judged without stalling`, which carries about 60038 characters
# of matching material in order to sit far above the 4096-character cap inside
# `mask_subs`. Two more outrun grep's read buffer, at about 40119 and 56020. A cap
# below any of them denies the fixture before the code it exercises ever runs, so
# lowering this bound means shrinking them and losing what they pin. Two of the
# three assert DENY, so a cap deny would satisfy them while no longer reaching the
# rule they exist for; the suite's own deny assertion refuses a cap deny for
# exactly that reason, which turns a cap lowered out from under a fixture into a
# red test rather than a silent retirement.
#
# Crossing either DENIES rather than truncating the scan. Judging the first N
# and passing the rest is a fail-open with extra steps, since the material a
# truncated scan drops is exactly where a secret would sit. Both sit far above
# any ordinary write: a dotenv-shaped file carries a handful of these lines
# rather than hundreds, and a few hundred characters of them rather than tens of
# thousands. The checks are two greps over content already in memory, so they
# cannot be what makes a write expensive.
#
# The line count is read and judged before the material itself is materialized,
# so the payload that crosses BOTH caps is rejected without first building a
# copy of what it is about to reject.

      # The mask is NOT verdict-preserving, and erasing a body erases whatever
      # it held. Rather than assert a bound this does not have, the consequences
      # that follow from it, each verified and each pinned by a test:
      #
      #   - An assignment sitting between a `$(` and its first `)` goes away
      #     with the body, so one parked inside a substitution clears where the
      #     truncated fragments used to deny.
      #   - The erased body can take an inner `>` with it, so a `<…>` wrapper
      #     that the `>` used to disqualify (`<$(cmd 2>/dev/null)>`) reads as a
      #     whole placeholder and clears. The PRIMARY value does NOT reach this
      #     one, so here the tail is the more permissive of the two.
      #   - Erasing an assignment also erases the evidence that the tail HAD
      #     one, which is why the flag is read separately below, off the
      #     unmasked tail. Without that split the mask denies where the old
      #     split allowed.
      #
      # None of this hands a writer concealment the guard does not already give,
      # and the reason is the plain `<…>` arm rather than anything about the
      # mask: `<hunter2xyz123>` is allowed in BOTH positions by `^<[^>]+>$`
      # today, so a bracket wrapper already conceals a bare 13+ run wherever it
      # appears. The mask changes which BODY reaches that arm, not whether the
      # arm admits a wrapped literal.
      #
      # The mask carries the substitution arm's own bound, `[^)]+`, so it stops
      # at the first `)` and, like the arm, declines an EMPTY body: `$()` is
      # denied in both positions rather than in the primary alone. A greedy body
      # would run to the LAST `)` on the line and swallow an assignment parked
      # between two substitutions, which is the one thing the split still has to
      # see. Masking and collapsing are independent, since the collapse touches
      # no `$`, `(`, or `)`; only running both before the `tr` matters.
      #
      # The operators collapse to `;` so the split needs only `tr`, which keeps
      # this portable to BSD `sed` (no `\n` in a replacement). The loop is fed
      # by process substitution rather than a pipe so it runs in this shell and
      # its flag survives.
      #
      # SC2016 fires on the mask's `$(@)` replacement. Not expanding is the
      # whole point: it has to reach `sed` as the literal text the masked value
      # becomes, and expanding it would run `@` as a command.

  # The cut point is located on a length-preserving mask of the value and then
  # applied to the UNMASKED value by offset, so a separator sitting inside a
  # `$(…)` body cannot open a tail. Locating it on the raw value instead cuts
  # `$(cmd 2>/dev/null || true) # note` at the body's own `||` and leaves
  # `$(cmd`, a fragment with no closing paren that no arm can match, so the deny
  # tells its author to use an environment variable on a line that already runs
  # a command to fetch one. Masking only the LOCATOR is what keeps that honest:
  # `value_allowed` still reads the true value, and the untrimmed judgement
  # above still runs first, so the two orderings agree.
  #
  # The mask writes `x`, so it can only REMOVE a separator, never add one, and a
  # cut can therefore only move later. Every value it newly ADMITS is one the
  # untrimmed judgement above already admits when the same line carries no tail,
  # so nothing reaches an arm here that could not already reach it there.
  #
  # A later cut leaves MORE material in the value, so it can also turn an allow
  # into a deny, and one arm does: `^<[^>]+>$` can be satisfied by a truncated
  # prefix that the whole value fails on an inner `>`, as in `<$(a> ; b)>`. Both
  # of those movements run fail-CLOSED, and for that shape the whole-value read
  # is the correct one, since it also denies `<$(<a-literal>> ; c)>` where the
  # truncated prefix cleared it.
  #
  # Its limit is the separator grammar's, not the mask's, and the grammar is
  # unchanged: an executable separator still has to be preceded by whitespace to
  # open a tail. So `FOO_KEY=$(cmd || true); export FOO_KEY` is read as one
  # value through to the `; export FOO_KEY` and denied. Widening the grammar to
  # bare separators is what a dotenv value cannot survive, since `a;b` is an
