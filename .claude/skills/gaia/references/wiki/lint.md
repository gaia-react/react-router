# wiki-lint playbook

Dispatched by the `/gaia-wiki` router (`references/wiki.md` → "Lint"). Runs in a Haiku subagent context.

## Playbook

Standalone GAIA-native wiki lint. Builds its own report shell, then writes GAIA-specific checks: **#11: Wiki drift check**, **#12: Dead repo-relative paths**, **#13: UAT/SPEC narrative-ref drift**, **#14: Orphan pages**, **#15: Frontmatter gaps**, and **#16: Empty sections**. Every check re-derives from a live `.gaia/cli/gaia wiki` CLI primitive on each run; the report is plain markdown that GAIA owns end to end.

## Step 1: Create the report shell

Compute today's date from the shell clock first: no LLM has a clock, so the model's notion of "today" is unreliable.

```bash
DATE=$(date +%F)
```

**Regenerate the report from scratch every run.** A lint report is a point-in-time snapshot; a stale report from an earlier run must never be reused or renamed into today's slot. `wiki/meta/` is release-excluded, so a freshly scaffolded adopter clone has no such directory yet; create it before any report write. Then remove any same-day report so a stale one cannot be picked up and patched in place:

```bash
mkdir -p wiki/meta/
rm -f wiki/meta/lint-report-$DATE.md
```

Then create the report file with the standard frontmatter and H1 heading:

```bash
cat > wiki/meta/lint-report-$DATE.md <<EOF
---
type: meta
title: 'Lint Report $DATE'
created: $DATE
updated: $DATE
tags: [meta, lint]
status: developing
---

# Lint Report: $DATE
EOF
```

Use `wiki/meta/lint-report-$DATE.md` as the canonical report path for every subsequent step and the Step 8 summary. The GAIA checks below write into this same file: each **replaces** its own `## #NN` section if one already exists, otherwise appends it at the bottom. Never trust or carry over a pre-existing GAIA section: every check re-derives from its live CLI primitive on each run.

## Step 2: GAIA check #11: Wiki drift

Always run `.gaia/cli/gaia wiki state --json` fresh and write the `## #11: Wiki drift check` section from its output, replacing any existing `## #11` section in the report. Never carry over a `#11` section from a reused report: drift state is the most time-sensitive check, and a stale `#11` is exactly how a wiki that was just synced or recovered gets mis-reported as drifting.

### 2a. Run the primitive

```bash
.gaia/cli/gaia wiki state --json
```

The CLI returns a JSON object with `drift_severity` (`none` | `low` | `medium` | `high`), `head_short`, `state_sha`, `commits_ahead`, `reachable`, `recent_commits`, and `suggested_base`. If the command exits non-zero with `state_missing` (or equivalent reason), append:

```markdown
## #11: Wiki drift check

⚠ `wiki/.state.json` missing: system has never run sync. Run `/gaia-wiki sync` to initialize.
```

Then stop the drift check.

If `reachable === false`, the recorded SHA was orphaned (the squash-merge flow replaces the evaluated branch SHA on every merge). Append, and surface `suggested_base` when the CLI resolved a recovery baseline so the reader knows the window is recoverable, not lost:

```markdown
## #11: Wiki drift check

⚠ `wiki/.state.json` `last_evaluated_sha` (`<state_sha>`) is not reachable from HEAD (squashed/rewritten history). Run `/gaia-wiki sync`: it resolves a recovery baseline (`<suggested_base>`) and evaluates the un-evaluated window.
```

When `suggested_base` is empty (no recoverable baseline), drop the parenthetical and say `it re-anchors to HEAD.` instead. Then stop.

### 2b. Classify and append

Map the CLI's `drift_severity` and `commits_ahead` to the report section:

| `drift_severity` | Section to append                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`           | `✓ Wiki in sync with HEAD ({head_short}).`                                                                                 |
| `low`            | `ℹ {commits_ahead} commits behind HEAD. Run /gaia-wiki sync at next opportunity.`                                          |
| `medium`         | `⚠ {commits_ahead} commits behind HEAD. Run /gaia-wiki sync soon.` + recent commits list                                   |
| `high`           | `✗ {commits_ahead} commits behind HEAD. Wiki is significantly out of date. Run /gaia-wiki sync now.` + recent commits list |

For **medium** and **high**, list up to 5 of the `recent_commits` from the CLI output as `  - <sha> <subject>`.

Example WARN (`medium`) section:

```markdown
## #11: Wiki drift check

⚠ 7 commits behind HEAD. Run `/gaia-wiki sync` soon. Recent unsynced commits:

- a1b2c3d feat: add new module
- d4e5f6g fix: edge case in router
- h7i8j9k chore: bump deps
```

Example ERROR (`high`) section:

```markdown
## #11: Wiki drift check

✗ 14 commits behind HEAD. Wiki is significantly out of date. Run `/gaia-wiki sync` now. Recent unsynced commits:

- a1b2c3d feat: ...
- d4e5f6g fix: ...
- h7i8j9k chore: ...
- l0m1n2o docs: ...
- p3q4r5s refactor: ...
```

## Step 3: GAIA check #12: Dead repo-relative paths

Run the dead-paths primitive and append a `## #12: Dead repo-relative paths` section. Detects backticked paths in wiki body prose that reference files no longer present on disk (e.g. a hook removed in a refactor still cited in a concept page).

### 3a. Run the primitive

```bash
.gaia/cli/gaia wiki dead-paths --json
```

Returns `{ "dead": [{ "filePath": "...", "line": N, "path": "..." }, ...], "staleMarkers": [{ "filePath": "...", "line": N, "marker": "...", "problem": "unused" | "missing-reason" | "missing-path" }, ...] }`. Both arrays empty means clean.

### 3a-i. Exempting an illustration: the `gaia:hypothetical` marker

Some wiki sentences name a path precisely because no such file exists: an example of how a *future* file would be routed, or a worked example of a filename the repo would never really carry. Rewording the path into a `<name>` placeholder is the right move when the sentence is about a shape, and the scan already skips those. It is not available when the sentence turns on the concrete path, and neither is the removed-or-renamed bullet form, which would assert something untrue.

Mark that line instead. The marker sits on the citation's own line and names the same path, unbackticked, with a reason:

```markdown
… an unqualified glob would route a future `.claude/commands/tool.sh` here … <!-- gaia:hypothetical .claude/commands/tool.sh: the sentence is about how a future file would route, so the file must not exist -->
```

Three properties are deliberate:

- **Both halves are mandatory.** A marker missing either its path or its reason exempts nothing: the citation still reports, and the marker itself is reported as malformed. The two are reported apart, naming the half that is actually missing, because telling an author to supply the half they already wrote sends them to re-read the part they got right. The reason is what a later reader checks the exemption against.
- **The marker is reported once it stops exempting anything.** If the sentence goes, or the path becomes a real file, the scan reports the marker as unused. An exemption nothing recounts decays into a blind spot for a genuinely dead future citation of the same path.
- **It is scoped to its one line and to that exact path.** A real citation sitting beside a hypothetical one still reports.

Every such report appears under `staleMarkers`, and on the text output alongside the dead paths. The `problem` field carries which of the three it is. Treat one the way you treat a dead path: fix the line or drop the marker.

The marker travels with the page rather than with the scanner, which is why it works where a list inside the CLI cannot: an adopter can write one, and a marker on a line that never reaches an adopter clone does not reach it either.

### 3b. Append the section

If both arrays are empty:

```markdown
## #12: Dead repo-relative paths

✓ No dead repo-relative paths detected in wiki body prose.
```

Otherwise:

```markdown
## #12: Dead repo-relative paths

⚠ {dead.length} dead path reference(s) in wiki/, files no longer exist on disk:

- `wiki/concepts/Foo.md:23` → `.claude/hooks/old-hook.sh`
- `wiki/concepts/Bar.md:45` → `.claude/hooks/missing-helper.sh`

⚠ {staleMarkers.length} `gaia:hypothetical` marker(s) exempting nothing:

- `wiki/decisions/Baz.md:88` → unused, the line carries no matching dead path
- `wiki/decisions/Qux.md:12` → malformed, no reason given
- `wiki/decisions/Quux.md:5` → malformed, no path given
```

One line form per `problem` value; render each entry from the value the scan reported rather than from the nearest form on offer.

List every dead reference and every stale marker (one per line), and drop whichever heading has no entries. Do not truncate: the counts are small enough to be actionable.

## Step 4: GAIA check #13: UAT/SPEC narrative-ref drift

Detects narrative `UAT-NNN` and concrete maintainer `SPEC-NNN` references that crept into instruction files (`.claude/skills/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/rules/`, `.claude/hooks/`) and shipped extension surfaces (`.specify/extensions/gaia/{README.md, commands, lib, rules, templates}`). The rule rationale + structural-vs-narrative triage table lives in `.claude/rules/wiki-style.md` (Exceptions section).

<!-- gaia:maintainer-only:start -->
Both scans deliberately exclude `.gaia/tests/`: it is release-excluded maintainer-only test infrastructure that never reaches an adopter, so its UAT/SEC/TST test labels are legitimate SPEC-conformance traceability, not shipped-surface drift. Do not re-add `.gaia/tests/` to either grep.
<!-- gaia:maintainer-only:end -->

### 4a. Run the greps

Two scans, run from the repo root:

```bash
# UAT-NNN narrative-ref candidates
grep -rEn "UAT-[0-9]{3}" \
  .claude/skills/ .claude/commands/ .claude/agents/ .claude/rules/ .claude/hooks/ \
  .specify/extensions/gaia/README.md .specify/extensions/gaia/commands/ \
  .specify/extensions/gaia/lib/ .specify/extensions/gaia/rules/ \
  .specify/extensions/gaia/templates/

# Concrete maintainer SPEC IDs
grep -rEn "\bSPEC-[0-9]{3,}\b" \
  .claude/skills/ .claude/commands/ .claude/agents/ .claude/rules/ .claude/hooks/ \
  .specify/extensions/gaia/README.md .specify/extensions/gaia/commands/ \
  .specify/extensions/gaia/lib/ .specify/extensions/gaia/rules/ \
  .specify/extensions/gaia/templates/
```

### 4b. Triage and append

Both scans return raw match lines. Apply the structural-vs-narrative filter from `wiki-style.md`:

- **Skip (structural, not findings):** template format examples (`> - UAT-NNN → Given …`), CLI argument values (`--uat-id UAT-007`), JS/Python/YAML literals (`uat_id: 'UAT-099'`), regex targets that match SPEC YAML structure, filename literals (`uat-001.spec.ts`), illustrative `(e.g. SPEC-002)` examples in usage docs, generic placeholders (`SPEC-NNN`, `SPEC-NNN.md`), variable-name fragments (`uat_id`, `uats_block`).
- **Flag (narrative, findings):** section-header parentheticals (`#### 5b. Discuss-this escape (UAT-004)`), inline narrative parentheticals (`(UAT-022, UAT-027)`), comments naming specific working-doc IDs, pass/fail label prefixes (`pass "UAT-001 …"`), prose using a maintainer SPEC ID as a system-wide constant (`operate under SPEC-001's scope_boundaries`).

If both scans produce zero narrative findings (all matches are structural):

```markdown
## #13: UAT/SPEC narrative-ref drift

✓ No narrative `UAT-NNN` or concrete maintainer `SPEC-NNN` references detected outside the structural exemptions in `.claude/rules/wiki-style.md`.
```

Otherwise:

```markdown
## #13: UAT/SPEC narrative-ref drift

⚠ {N} narrative ref(s) found in instruction files / shipped extension surfaces:

- `.claude/skills/foo/SKILL.md:42` → `(UAT-012)` parenthetical in section header
- `.specify/extensions/gaia/commands/bar.md:88` → `operate under SPEC-001's scope_boundaries` prose
```

List every narrative finding (one per line). Structural matches are not listed: they are the regex's false positives by design.

## Step 5: GAIA check #14: Orphan pages

Run the orphans primitive and append a `## #14: Orphan pages` section, replacing any existing `## #14` section. Detects wiki pages that no other page links to with a wikilink.

### 5a. Run the primitive

```bash
.gaia/cli/gaia wiki orphans --json
```

Returns `{ "orphans": [{ "path": "...", "title": "...", "domain": "..." }, ...] }`. Empty array means clean.

Intentionally-unlinked maintainer-only pages are kept reachable via marker-wrapped links in `wiki/index.md`, so a page that shows up here is a genuine orphan: it signals a missing cross-reference, not a maintainer page.

### 5b. Append the section

If `orphans.length === 0`:

```markdown
## #14: Orphan pages

✓ No orphan pages (every page has at least one inbound wikilink).
```

Otherwise:

```markdown
## #14: Orphan pages

⚠ {orphans.length} orphan page(s), no inbound wikilinks:

- `wiki/concepts/Foo.md` (Foo Concept)
- `wiki/modules/Bar.md` (Bar Module)
```

List every orphan (one per line) as ``- `wiki/path.md` (title)``.

## Step 6: GAIA check #15: Frontmatter gaps

Run the frontmatter primitive and append a `## #15: Frontmatter gaps` section, replacing any existing `## #15` section. The required floor is `type` and `status`.

### 6a. Run the primitive

```bash
.gaia/cli/gaia wiki frontmatter --json
```

Returns `{ "gaps": [{ "path": "...", "missing": ["type", "status"] }, ...] }`. Empty array means clean.

### 6b. Append the section

If `gaps.length === 0`:

```markdown
## #15: Frontmatter gaps

✓ All wiki pages carry the required frontmatter (type, status).
```

Otherwise:

```markdown
## #15: Frontmatter gaps

⚠ {gaps.length} page(s) missing required frontmatter:

- `wiki/concepts/Foo.md`: missing status
- `wiki/modules/Bar.md`: missing status, tags
```

List every gap (one per line) as ``- `wiki/path.md`: missing {comma-joined fields}``.

## Step 7: GAIA check #16: Empty sections

Run the empty-sections primitive and append a `## #16: Empty sections` section, replacing any existing `## #16` section. Detects headings with no body content beneath them.

### 7a. Run the primitive

```bash
.gaia/cli/gaia wiki empty-sections --json
```

Returns `{ "empty": [{ "path": "...", "line": N, "heading": "..." }, ...] }`. Empty array means clean.

### 7b. Append the section

If `empty.length === 0`:

```markdown
## #16: Empty sections

✓ No empty sections detected.
```

Otherwise:

```markdown
## #16: Empty sections

⚠ {empty.length} empty section(s):

- `wiki/concepts/Foo.md:42` → `## Heading`
- `wiki/modules/Bar.md:88` → `### Subheading`
```

List every empty section (one per line) as `` - `wiki/path.md:42` → `## Heading` ``.

## Step 8: Surface to the user

Print to the user:

1. The report path (e.g. `wiki/meta/lint-report-2026-05-03.md`).
2. A one-line summary that includes the drift severity and count, plus dead-path count, stale-marker count, orphan count, frontmatter-gap count, and empty-section count when any of those is non-zero, plus narrative-ref count if non-zero.

If `drift_severity` is **`high`**, surface it prominently (separate line, prefixed with `WIKI DRIFT:`).
If `dead.length + staleMarkers.length > 0`, surface as a separate line prefixed with `WIKI DEAD-PATHS:` followed by both counts. A run whose only finding is a stale marker still has to reach the user: gating this line on `dead.length` alone leaves it in the report file and out of the summary, which is the one channel this step has.
If narrative-ref findings > 0, surface as a separate line prefixed with `UAT-SPEC DRIFT:` followed by the count.
If `orphans.length > 0`, surface as a separate line prefixed with `WIKI ORPHANS:` followed by the count.
If `gaps.length > 0`, surface as a separate line prefixed with `WIKI FRONTMATTER:` followed by the count.
If `empty.length > 0`, surface as a separate line prefixed with `WIKI EMPTY-SECTIONS:` followed by the count.

## Notes

- Hooks (drift-check, commit-nudge, session-stop) are read-only consumers of `wiki/.state.json`. Only sync writes to it. This workflow also does not write `wiki/.state.json`.
- Drift count semantics: missing state file or unreachable SHA are surfaced as advisories, not silent zeroes. See [[Wiki Sync]] for the full design.
- Severity table thresholds are the canonical thresholds for this plan; if changing, update both this file and any sibling tooling that classifies drift.
