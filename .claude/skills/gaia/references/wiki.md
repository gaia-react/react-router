# /gaia-wiki

Wiki-maintenance router. Sub-commands run individually or chain end-to-end.

## Argument parsing

Tokenize `$ARGUMENTS`. Detect a trailing `--force` token; if present, strip
it and set `FORCE=true`. Then tokenize the first remaining whitespace-
separated word.

| First arg       | Action                                                                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sync`          | Dispatch sync subagent (see "Sync" below). No chaining.                      |
| `consolidate`   | Dispatch consolidate detection subagent (see "Consolidate" below). No chain. |
| `lint`          | Dispatch lint subagent (see "Lint" below). No chaining.                      |
| (empty)         | Full chain: sync → (gated) consolidate → lint. See "Full chain".             |
| (anything else) | Print help.                                                                  |

`--force` is positional-flexible but the contract is "trailing", it must be
the LAST argument so it doesn't shadow `sync` / `consolidate` / `lint`:

- `/gaia-wiki --force` (full chain, force)
- `/gaia-wiki sync --force` (sync only, force)

Help message:

```
Usage: /gaia-wiki [--force] [sync|consolidate|lint]

  --force        Override GAIA CI deferral (no-op when wiki.mode != "ci")
  (no arg)       Full chain: sync, then consolidate if gate trips, then lint
  sync           Evaluate commits since last sync; update wiki where warranted
  consolidate    Cross-SPEC redundancy + contradiction audit; surfaces findings
  lint           Health check: orphans, dead links, drift, narrative-ref scrub
```

## GAIA CI deferral check

Before any sub-command dispatches (sync / consolidate / lint / full chain),
the parent reads `.gaia/automation.json` to determine whether wiki updates
are CI-managed.

```
STATUS=$(.gaia/cli/gaia automation read-config --json 2>/dev/null \
         | jq -r '.wiki.mode // "local"') || STATUS=local
```

If the binary or config is missing the read fails; treat that as `local`
and proceed.

If `STATUS == "ci"` and `FORCE != "true"`, print this conflict-risk
warning to stderr and exit 1 without dispatching anything:

```
GAIA CI manages /gaia-wiki for this repo. Running it locally now risks colliding
with the next scheduled run. To override, re-invoke with --force.
```

**On this abort, only when there is no sub-argument** (the full-chain
invocation), record cost before exiting, no `--github-*` flags, the run opened
nothing:

```bash
bash .gaia/scripts/token-tally.sh --action command --command gaia-wiki
```

A deferred `sync`, `consolidate`, or `lint` (a sub-argument is present) hits
this same abort but records **nothing**: the no-sub-argument gate above is
what keeps a standalone stage from writing a cost record it never should.

This is the only cost record the router itself emits. The full chain's cost
record comes from `gaia wiki chain finish` (`chain.ts`, every normal path:
success, empty branch, in-place, any git/gh failure); do not add a second
call here or anywhere else in this file.

If `STATUS == "ci"` and `FORCE == "true"`, the chain runs as normal.

If `STATUS != "ci"`, behave as before (no defer, no force).

## Sync

Dispatch a Sonnet subagent via `Agent`. Sync generates judgment and prose (deep-reading WORTHY diffs, locating the right page, writing accurate edits and ADRs), which is beyond Haiku's reliability on a long multi-step run; a fresh context also keeps git diffs and log content out of the parent.

Spawn:

- `subagent_type`: `"general-purpose"`
- `model`: `"sonnet"`
- `description`: `"Wiki sync"`
- `prompt`: the string below (literal, no paraphrasing):

  > `You are running the GAIA wiki-sync workflow in a fresh context. Read .claude/skills/gaia/references/wiki/sync.md from the project root and execute the "Playbook" section (Steps 1–9) verbatim. Your working directory is the project root. Print only the final summary block from Step 8 followed by the CONSOLIDATE_TRIGGERED line from Step 9, no preamble, no recap, no narration of intermediate steps.`

When the subagent returns, relay its final summary verbatim. Do not redo the work in the parent.

Standalone (the sub-arg form `/gaia-wiki sync`): after relaying the summary, run the "Await the landing" section below. The no-arg full chain does **not** await here: step 2's Step 7 commits in place on the pre-cut chain branch and opens no PR, so nothing has landed yet at this point, the chain's one await call is at step 6 (finish), after the actual landing.

If invoked as `/gaia-wiki sync` (sub-arg form): stop after the await completes. Do **not** chain into consolidate or lint, that's only the no-arg form's job. The sub-arg form `/gaia-wiki sync --force` is also valid; the same defer / force logic from "GAIA CI deferral check" applies.

Standalone, sync's Step 7 lands on its own: from `main` it cuts a `wiki-sync/<date>-<sha>` branch, opens its own PR, and queues auto-merge, then takes one bounded in-CLI wait; normally it returns with the local cleanup outstanding, because the merge gate outlasts any wait that fits in one call (same mechanism as `chain finish`); from a feature branch it commits in place. In the no-arg full chain the parent pre-cuts the branch via `chain begin`, so the same Step 7 commits in place on the chain branch and the chain opens a single PR at the end (see "Full chain").

## Await the landing

Call this after relaying a stage's final summary. This call is unconditional: it is correct on a run
that landed on a branch, on a run that committed in place, and on a run whose cleanup already
happened, because the verb discovers for itself whether a landing is pending and writes nothing
when none is.

Run `.gaia/cli/gaia wiki sync await` with an explicit Bash `timeout` of `600000`. The call
blocks while it polls, and the Bash tool's DEFAULT timeout is 120000, not its maximum, so the
timeout must be passed at the call site or the slice is killed early. A killed slice is treated
as still pending and falls through to the session-start janitor, leaving no partial branch state.

Read the last two lines of stdout. The `WIKI_AWAIT: <state>` marker is the last line, and the
verb's human-readable summary is the line before it, which is the one to relay:

- empty output: nothing to await. Say nothing and move on.
- `WIKI_AWAIT: merged`: relay the verb's summary line. The local branch is deleted and base is
  caught up.
- `WIKI_AWAIT: pending`: run the same command again, same explicit timeout, but re-run at most
  once. If the second call still reports `WIKI_AWAIT: pending`, stop, do not call a third time,
  and hand off to the session-start janitor: it catches base up on a later session.
- `WIKI_AWAIT: exhausted`: relay the verb's summary line, which names why the verb stopped: either
  the wait ran out with the merge still pending, or the merge landed but the local catch-up could
  not run from this checkout. Either way the session-start janitor catches base up on a later
  session. Relay the line rather than restating it, so a reason added later still reaches the
  reader.

The two-call bound above is what actually ends this prose loop, not the verb's own ceiling. The
default `GAIA_WIKI_AWAIT_CEILING_SECONDS` (660 seconds) is measured from the first call, while each
call's own merge-poll is a separate, shorter budget (up to 4 minutes) that takes no ceiling
argument, so the ceiling has usually not elapsed by the second call; it typically first fires on
the third or fourth. Setting it to `0` disables the await entirely and leaves the catch-up to the
janitor.

## Consolidate

Two-stage. **Detection (Steps 1–3) runs in a Sonnet subagent** so the heavy page-index walk and frontmatter reads stay out of the parent. **Apply, state, and report (Steps 4–6) run in the parent** because Step 4 calls `AskUserQuestion` per finding, and `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable inside dispatched subagents.

### Stage 1, detection subagent

Spawn:

- `subagent_type`: `"general-purpose"`
- `model`: `"sonnet"`
- `description`: `"Wiki consolidate (detection)"`
- `prompt`: the string below (literal):

  > `You are running the detection stage of the GAIA wiki-consolidate workflow in a fresh context. Read .claude/skills/gaia/references/wiki/consolidate.md from the project root and execute Steps 1–3 of the "Playbook" section verbatim, then STOP. Do NOT execute Steps 4–6. Your working directory is the project root. After writing the report file in Step 3, return ONLY a JSON payload on stdout, no preamble, no narration:`
  >
  > ```json
  > {
  >   "report_path": "wiki/meta/consolidate-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md",
  >   "findings": [
  >     {
  >       "id": "<stable id, e.g. supersession-0, near-collision-2>",
  >       "kind": "supersession" | "reversed" | "near_collision" | "subject_orphan",
  >       "domain": "<domain>",
  >       "label": "<short label suitable for a question>",
  >       "canonical": { "path": "<rel path>", "title": "<title>", "slug": "<slug>" },
  >       "other":     { "path": "<rel path>", "title": "<title>", "slug": "<slug>" },
  >       "summary":   "<one-sentence summary of the apply action>"
  >     }
  >   ]
  > }
  > ```

### Stage 2, parent loop

After the subagent returns, the parent (the agent reading this file in the live conversation):

1. Parses the `findings[]` payload.
2. Iterates findings in order **supersession → reversed → near-collision → subject-orphan** (most-impactful first), surfacing each via `AskUserQuestion` per Step 4 of the playbook in `references/wiki/consolidate.md`.
3. Applies the user's chosen action (Apply / Keep both / Skip) per the playbook's per-kind rules.
4. Runs Step 5 (advance state) and Step 6 (hand off + report) directly.

If any HIGH-severity supersession or reversed-decision finding is applied, surface it prominently (prefix the final summary line with `WIKI CONSOLIDATE:`).

## Lint

Dispatch a Haiku subagent via `Agent`. The work is mechanical (rule-based orphan/dead-link/frontmatter checks plus a deterministic drift severity table), Haiku is sufficient.

Spawn:

- `subagent_type`: `"general-purpose"`
- `model`: `"haiku"`
- `description`: `"Wiki lint"`
- `prompt`: the string below (literal):

  > `You are running the GAIA wiki-lint workflow in a fresh context. Read .claude/skills/gaia/references/wiki/lint.md from the project root and execute the "Playbook" section (Steps 1–8) verbatim. Your working directory is the project root. Return only the report path and the one-line summary required by Step 8: no recap of the report contents.`

When the subagent returns, relay its summary verbatim. If the drift severity is **`high`**, prefix the surfaced line with `WIKI DRIFT:` per Step 8. If the subagent returns a `WIKI DEAD-PATHS:`, `UAT-SPEC DRIFT:`, `WIKI ORPHANS:`, `WIKI FRONTMATTER:`, or `WIKI EMPTY-SECTIONS:` line, surface it too.

## Full chain (no sub-arg)

The whole chain lands on **one branch and one PR**, not one PR per stage. The parent (the agent reading this file) owns the branch lifecycle through `gaia wiki chain`; each stage still runs as its own subagent. The `chain` calls are the only parent-side git/branch/PR actions, the playbook bans inlining any other branch logic, manual `gh pr` calls, or push narrative.

1. **Begin the chain.** Run `.gaia/cli/gaia wiki chain begin --branch-aware`. On `main`/`master` it cuts a `wiki-sync/<date>-<sha>` branch so every stage commits there instead of landing separately; on a feature branch it is a no-op and the chain commits in place. Proceed regardless of which.

2. **Sync.** Run the "Sync" section above. Capture the final summary. The chain branch is already checked out, so sync's Step 7 (`gaia wiki sync land --branch-aware`) commits in place on the chain branch rather than opening its own PR.

3. **Inspect last line of summary.** Step 9 of sync emits `CONSOLIDATE_TRIGGERED: <true|false>` as the summary's last line on normal sync paths (including drift=0). The line is **absent** on the re-anchor path (Step 1 rebase recovery) and on every interruption and abort `references/wiki/sync.md`'s Failure modes section lists, all of which leave the wiki in a known-incomplete state. Branch on its presence:
   - **Line absent**: skip consolidate and lint, then go straight to step 6 (finish) and surface the exceptional state. `chain finish` lands a lone re-anchor commit, removes the branch if sync committed nothing, or leaves an aborted (uncommitted) tree in place for the maintainer.
   - **`CONSOLIDATE_TRIGGERED: true`**: run consolidate (step 4), then lint (step 5), then finish (step 6).
   - **`CONSOLIDATE_TRIGGERED: false`**: skip consolidate, run lint (step 5), then finish (step 6).

4. **Consolidate.** Run the "Consolidate" section above. After its apply loop completes, commit the staged edits: `.gaia/cli/gaia wiki chain commit --label "wiki: consolidate through <head-sha>"` (the short HEAD sha sync reported in `State advanced to {head_sha}`). The command is a no-op when nothing was applied.

5. **Lint.** Run the "Lint" section above. Lint runs after consolidate because consolidate may move, rename, or archive pages and lint's orphan/dead-link/drift checks need the true post-state. After the lint subagent returns, commit its report: `.gaia/cli/gaia wiki chain commit --label "wiki: lint through <head-sha>"`.

6. **Finish the chain.** Run `.gaia/cli/gaia wiki chain finish --branch-aware` with an explicit Bash `timeout` of `600000`. On the chain branch it pushes, opens ONE PR carrying every stage's commit, enables auto-merge, then takes one bounded in-CLI wait; on the common path it returns to base with the local cleanup outstanding, because the merge gate outlasts any wait that fits in one call. If the merge does not land within the wait, auto-merge stays queued (GitHub completes it once checks pass) and the local pull/delete is deferred to the session-start janitor. If no stage produced a commit it drops the empty branch and returns to base. On a feature-branch (in-place) run it is a no-op and the commits remain on the current branch. Relay its summary to the user.

   After relaying the summary, run the "Await the landing" section above.

Each stage still dispatches its own subagent; never run their playbooks yourself in this conversation.
